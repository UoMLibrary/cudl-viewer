# These are properties which _must_ be defined for the Viewer's Application Context to be created.
#
# TODO: Going forward It'd be best to minimise these in favour of making features optional based on the presence of
#       configuration, rather than expecting thing to be on. That way things are easier to test, and the Viewer is more
#       flexible for the varying requirements of different deployments.
#       Additionally, rather than requiring a property directly, it's better if a bean expects an implementation of an
#       interface, and have a concrete implementation use the property. That way in testing, the interface can be mocked
#       by default, and the property is not required.
