Building Foundations Viewer

FOR ALL DEPLOYMENTS YOU WILL NEED TO ENSURE

cudl-global.properties 

is on the classpath and specifies properties appropriate to where it is deployed. 
For DEV and LIVE this is already setup and is in the tomcat/lib directory, 
and under version control. 

-----------------------------------
To test locally run the command:

mvn jetty:run 

and you will be able to access the site on the URL 

http://localhost:1111

-----------------------------------

If you use Eclipse as your IDE you can import the project 
and on the command line run the following command:

mvn eclipse:eclipse

This will create a .project and .classpath files to setup this project 
to work with Eclipse.  

-----------------------------------
To build into a war file use the command:

mvn clean package

which will create a war file in the target directory called FoundationsViewer.war
this can be copied to the webapps directory of a tomcat to be deployed. 

-----------------------------------
DEPLOYING UPDATES TO DEV

1. Build war file
2. SSH into found-dev-pres01.lib.cam.ac.uk (you may need to go via a caret machine)
3. Change user to 'digilib'
4. Remove / archive existing war at /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/FoundationsViewer.war
5. Check that the existing FoundationsViewer folder in the webapps directory has 
been removed (removing the war file should do this).
5. Copy your new war file to /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/FoundationsViewer.war
6. Restart the tomcat as the user digilib (or as root using /etc/init.d/tomcat-viewer restart command)
This should automatically deploy the new war file.
