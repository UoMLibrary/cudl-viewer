Tagging procedure for a new release:

Update Database (if new content):

  Dump the items, itemsincollection and collections tables
  (these will be loaded in during the release). 

    dump item tables from dev:

	mysqldump -u viewerdevuser -p --host=found-dom01.lib.cam.ac.uk viewerdev items itemsincollection collections > Desktop/db_<RELEASE>.sql

    Loading into live:
    
    When you are performing the release, you can then update the data using the command:
    (NOTE THIS WILL DESTROY EXISTING TABLES - BACKUP FIRST!)

	mysql -u viewerliveuser -p --host=found-dom01.lib.cam.ac.uk viewerlive < Desktop/db_<RELEASE>.sql

XTF: 

  Need to manually tag these using the command (note svn tags cannot be changed after they are created). 

  svn copy https://source.caret.cam.ac.uk/svn/projects/ul-foundations/xtf/trunk \
      https://source.caret.cam.ac.uk/svn/projects/ul-foundations/xtf/tags/<TAG_NUMBER> -m "Release <TAG_NUMBER>"


Viewer:

  Use the following command, that prompts you for a version number.  
  Also it will create a tag in SVN and it will update the pom to the new version for you. 

  mvn release:prepare
