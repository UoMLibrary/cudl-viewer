    				<h2>Foundations of Faith and Science</h2>
    				<p>Over the course of six centuries Cambridge University
    					Library's collections have grown from a few dozen volumes into one
    					of the world's great libraries, with an extraordinary accumulation
    					of books, maps, manuscripts and journals. These cover every
    					conceivable aspect of human endeavour, spanning most of the world's
    					cultural traditions. While parts of the Library's manuscript
    					collections have already been published in print, microfilm and
    					digital formats, we are now building a substantial online resource
    					so that our collections can be much more accessible to students,
    					researchers and the wider public.</p>

    				<p>
    					<b>The first phase</b> of our work on the Cambridge Digital
    					Library, which ran from 2010 to 2014 was made possible through a
    					lead gift of Â£1.5m from Dr Leonard Polonsky. This generous support
    					has enabled the Library to develop its technical infrastructure and
    					create significant content, particularly in the areas of faith and
    					science - two areas of strength within our collections. It has also
    					enabled us to attract funding from other sources, including the
    					AHRC, NSF, NEH, JISC and other private donors.
    				</p>

    				<p>
    					The <b>Foundations of Faith</b> strand of content includes
    					important works from many religious traditions, particularly
    					Judaism, Islam, Christianity and Buddhism. In its initial phase,
    					the Digital Library has made available some of the <a
    						href="/collections/islamic">earliest Qur'anic fragments on
    						parchment</a>, important manuscripts in Hebrew, including one of the
    					earliest known copies of the Ten Commandments - the second- century
    					BCE <a href="/view/MS-OR-00233">Nash Papyrus</a>, and a large
    					selection of manuscripts from the <a href="/collections/genizah">Taylor-Schechter
    						Genizah Collection</a>, considered by many to be a collection as
    					significant as the Dead Sea Scrolls. Our online Christian holdings
    					include the <a href="/view/MS-NN-00002-00041">Codex Bezae
    						Cantabrigiensis</a> - one of the most interesting of all New Testament
    					manuscripts, and the remarkable <a href="/view/MS-II-00006-00032">Book
    						of Deer</a>. The end of this first phase is also marked by the release
    					of more than 500 manuscripts from the Library's extensive <a
    						href="/collections/sanskrit">Sanskrit collection</a>, including
    					some of the earliest surviving Buddhist manuscripts.
    				</p>


    				<p>
    					The <b>Foundations of Science</b> content draws on the very strong
    					collections the Library holds relating to the History of Science.
    					We began with the papers of <a href="/collections/newton">Isaac
    						Newton</a> and by the end of this phase have launched the first part
    					of a major release of Darwin's manuscripts - the <a
    						href="/collections/darwin_mss">papers and drafts that led to <i>The
    							Origin of Species</i></a>. We have also released the <a
    						href="/collections/longitude">Papers of the Board of Longitude</a>,
    					a fascinating and substantial archive charting scientific and
    					technological endeavors in the eighteenth and early nineteenth
    					centuries.
    				</p>

    				<p>

    					Wherever possible we are seeking to enhance our digital collections
    					by aligning them with scholarly research. The <a
    						href="/collections/newton">Newton Papers</a> and <a
    						href="/collections/darwin_mss">Darwin Manuscripts</a> are good
    					examples. Collaborations with the <a
    						href="http://www.newtonproject.sussex.ac.uk/">Newton Project</a>
    					at Sussex and the <a
    						href="http://www.amnh.org/our-research/darwin-manuscripts-project">Darwin
    						Manuscripts Project</a> at the American Museum of Natural History have
    					enabled us to provide transcriptions alongside our facsimile
    					images. Outputs from the Library's own research units, the
    					Taylor-Schechter Genizah Research Unit and the Darwin
    					Correspondence Project are also incorporated in the <a
    						href="/collections/genizah">Genizah Collections</a> and Darwin
    					correspondence and manuscripts collections. Our <a
    						href="/collections/sanskrit">Sanskrit Collection</a>, <a
    						href="/collections/spanishchapbooks">Spanish Chapbooks</a>
    					collection and <a href="/collections/longitude">Board of
    						Longitude</a> collection have all been significantly enriched through
    					major AHRC research projects.


    				</p>

    				<p>Another goal is to make content from the Digital Library
    					freely available for use within teaching and research. Copyright
    					and licensing will not always permit this, but where it does we are
    					providing good quality images and texts for download and reuse.
    					During the next phase of the programme we will be doing work to
    					enable us to more easily distribute the content using automated
    					tools - so that it can effortlessly be embedded within other
    					websites and presentations. So while the Cambridge Digital Library
    					will continue to provide a focus for our collections, we look
    					forward to encountering our content in many other parts of the
    					online world.</p>


    				<p>
    					Much more content and further functionality is planned for 2015 and
    					2016, but hope you will find the collections we've already included
    					stimulating and the website easy to use. If you have any questions
    					or suggestions, please <a class="iframe" href="/feedbackform.html">let
    						us know</a>.
