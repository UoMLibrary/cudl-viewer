					<p>Over the course of six centuries Cambridge University
						Library's collections have grown from a few dozen volumes into one
						of the world's great libraries, with an extraordinary accumulation
						of books, maps, manuscripts and journals. These cover every
						conceivable aspect of human endeavour, spanning millennia and most
						of the world's cultural traditions. While parts of the Library's
						collections have already been published in print, microfilm and
						digital formats, we are now building a substantial online resource
						so that our collections can be much more accessible to students,
						researchers and the wider public.</p>
					<p>We have called the first phase of our work on the Cambridge
						Digital Library the <b>Foundations Project</b>, which runs from mid-2010
						to mid-2013 and has been made possible through a lead gift of
						&pound;1.5m by Dr Leonard Polonsky. This generous support will enable
						the Library to develop its technical infrastructure and create
						significant content in the areas of faith and science - two areas
						of particular strength within our collections.</p>

					<p><b>The Foundations of Faith Collection</b> will include important
						works from many religious traditions, particularly Judaism, Islam,
						Christianity and Buddhism. The Library's faith collections are
						breathtaking. They include some of the oldest and most significant
						Qur'ans ever to be uncovered, as well as an Eighth Century copy of
						Surat al-Anfal. The Library holds the world's largest and most
						important collection of Jewish Genizah materials, including the
						Taylor-Schechter Genizah Collection - 193,000 fragments of
						manuscripts considered by many to be as significant as the Dead
						Sea Scrolls. Our Christian holdings include the Codex Bezae
						Cantabrigiensis, one of the most important New Testament
						manuscripts, and the Book of Dear and Book of Cerne. Among the
						Library's substantial Sanskrit collection are some of the earliest
						surviving Buddhist manuscripts.</p>

					<p><b>The Foundations of Science Collection</b> will focuses on
						scientific works, beginning with the papers of Isaac Newton and
						his contemporaries. Cambridge University Library has very strong
						collections in the history of Science. In addition to our Newton
						collection, the Library holds the papers of Charles Darwin, Lord
						Kelvin, Adam Sedgwick, J.J. Thomson, Ernest Rutherford, James
						Clerk Maxwell and Sir George Gabriel Stokes. It is also the
						repository of the Royal Greenwich Observatory archives, which
						includes the papers of the Astronomers Royal and the Board of
						Longitude papers, and the archives of Cambridge's Cavendish
						Laboratory.</p>

					<p>
						In addition to our major collections relating to faith and
						science, we intend to make other treasures from the Library
						available within the Cambridge Digital Library. Wherever possible
						we will seek to enhance our digital collections by aligning them
						with scholarly research. Our first release of content, the Newton
						Papers, is a good example. We have collaborated with the <a
							href="http://www.newtonproject.sussex.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Newton
							Project</a> to provide transcriptions alongside images of Newton's
						manuscripts.
					</p>
					<p>Another goal is to make content from the Digital Library
						freely available for use within teaching and research. Copyright
						and licensing will not always permit this, but where it does we
						hope to provide good quality images and texts for educational use.</p>
