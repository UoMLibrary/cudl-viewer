					<h4>Welcome to Cambridge Digital Library: A home for the discovery of digitised material and
						research outputs from the University of Cambridge and beyond.</h4>
					<p>
						We hope you find what you are looking for – please do <a
							class="iframe" href="/feedbackform.html">contact us</a> if you
						have any questions or comments.
					</p>

					<h2>Our Mission, Vision & Values</h2>
					<p>The mission of the University of Cambridge is to contribute
						to society through the pursuit of education, learning, and
						research at the highest international levels of excellence.</p>

					<p>Cambridge Digital Library supports this mission through a
						vision based on our core values:</p>

					<ul>
						<li><b>Access</b> – We want our unique and distinctive collections
							to be openly accessible to as many people as possible.</li>
						<li><b>Collaboration</b> – By working together with partners across
							different local, national and international institutions we
							foster a platform for sharing that benefits all and extends our
							combined reach and effectiveness.</li>
						<li><b>Engagement</b> – We don’t just want to make our collections
							available, we also want to encourage people to use them and help
							us develop them further.</li>
						<li><b>Innovation</b> – We want to ensure the long-standing legacy
							of our content remains relevant as technologies evolve so that
							researchers will be able to study it long into the future in new
							and exciting ways.</li>
						<li><b>Inspiration</b> – Many of our collections focus on
							inspirational people and themes. We want to inspire a thirst for
							knowledge, understanding and further research.</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>Our Story so far</h2>
					<p>Over the course of six centuries Cambridge University
						Library's collections have grown from a few dozen volumes into one
						of the world's great libraries, with an extraordinary accumulation
						of material. The collections cover every conceivable aspect of
						human endeavour, spanning most of the world's cultural traditions.</p>

					<p>The first phase of work on Cambridge Digital Library, which
						ran from 2010 to 2014 was made possible through a lead gift of
						£1.5m from Dr Leonard Polonsky. This generous support has enabled
						the Library to develop its technical infrastructure and create
						significant content, particularly in the areas of faith and
						science - two areas of strength within our unique and distinctive
						collections. It has also enabled us to attract funding from other
						sources, including the AHRC, NSF, NEH, JISC and other private
						donors.</p>

					<p>
						Wherever possible we seek to enhance our digital collections by
						aligning them with scholarly research. Examples of this include
						not only collaborations with research projects based here within
						Cambridge University Library, such as the <a
							target="_blank" href="http://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/collections/departments/taylor-schechter-genizah-research-unit">Taylor-Schechter
							Genizah Research Unit</a> and the <a
							target="_blank" href="https://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/">Darwin Correspondence
							Project</a>, but also those from further afield such as the <a
							target="_blank" href="http://www.newtonproject.ox.ac.uk/">Newton Project</a> and
						the <a
							target="_blank" href="http://www.amnh.org/our-research/darwin-manuscripts-project">Darwin
							Manuscripts Project</a>, which is based at the American Museum of
						Natural History. Our Sanskrit Collection, Spanish Chapbooks
						collection and Board of Longitude collection have all been
						significantly enriched through major AHRC research projects.
					</p>

					<p>Another goal is to make content from the Digital Library
						freely available for use within teaching and research. Copyright
						and licensing will not always permit this, but where it does we
						are providing good quality images, texts and metadata for download
						and reuse. You can even embed our viewer straight into your own
						webpages and blogs.</p>

					<p>
						Given Cambridge’s heritage, we are also acutely aware of the need
						to preserve the work we do for future generations. With further
						funding from the Polonsky Foundation we are currently
						collaborating with Bodleian Libraries in Oxford on a <a
							target="_blank" href="https://www.dpoc.ac.uk/">project to enhance our digital
						preservation programme</a>.
					</p>

					<p>
						Cambridge Digital Library has become a platform for <a
							target="_blank" href="http://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/research/digital-humanities">digital
							humanities</a> activity within Cambridge and beyond. We have plenty
						of exciting projects in the pipeline - <a class="iframe"
							href="/mailinglistform.html" title="Keep me informed">sign up
							to our newsletter</a> or follow us on <a
							target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/CamDigLib">Twitter</a> or <a

						our latest updates (@CamDigLib). We also love to hear from you, so
						<a class="iframe" href="/feedbackform.html" title="Feedback">get
							in touch</a> with any comments or questions or even to find out if we
						can help you with your project.
