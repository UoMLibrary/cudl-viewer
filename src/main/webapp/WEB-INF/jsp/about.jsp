			<p>Over the course of six centuries Cambridge University
				Library's collections have grown from a few dozen volumes into one
				of the world's great libraries, with an extraordinary accumulation
				of books, maps, manuscripts and journals. These cover every
				conceivable aspect of human endeavour, spanning most of the world's
				cultural traditions. While parts of the Library's manuscript
				collections have already been published in print, microfilm and
				digital formats, we are now building a substantial online resource
				so that our collections can be much more accessible to students,
				researchers and the wider public.</p>
				
				<a href="" name="foundations"></a>
			<p>
				We have called the first phase of our work on the Cambridge Digital
				Library the <b>Foundations Project</b>, which runs from mid-2010 to
				mid-2013 and has been made possible through a lead gift of
				&pound;1.5m by Dr Leonard Polonsky. This generous support will
				enable the Library to develop its technical infrastructure and
				create significant content in the areas of faith and science - two
				areas of particular strength within our collections.
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>The Foundations of Faith Collection</b> will include important
				works from many religious traditions, particularly Judaism, Islam,
				Christianity and Buddhism. The Library's faith collections are
				breathtaking. They include some of the earliest Qur'anic fragments
				on parchment, the first known Qur'anic commentary written in
				Persian, an important selection of devotional works and mystical
				treatises and an outstanding collection of theological works
				including the unique extant copy of the Kit&#257;b al-Tawh&#299;d by
				al-M&#257;tur&#299;d&#299;.
			</p>
			<p>The Library has a collection of over 1000 manuscripts in
				Hebrew covering a wide range of texts; Bibles, commentaries,
				liturgy, philosophy, kabbalah, literature and legal documents. Most
				of these are in codex form though there are also scrolls and
				fragments; some date back to the earliest collections in the
				Library. The oldest manuscript in the collection is a copy of the
				Ten Commandments written on papyrus, and thought to date from the
				2nd century B.C.  The Library also holds the world's largest and most
				important collection of Jewish Genizah materials, including the
				Taylor-Schechter Genizah Collection - 193,000 fragments of
				manuscripts considered by many to be as significant as the Dead Sea
				Scrolls.</p>
			<p>Our Christian holdings include the Codex Bezae
				Cantabrigiensis, one of the most important New Testament
				manuscripts, the Moore Bede and the Book of Cerne. Among the
				Library's substantial Sanskrit collection are some of the earliest
				surviving Buddhist manuscripts.</p>

			<p>
				<b>The Foundations of Science Collection</b> will focus on original
				scientific manuscripts, beginning with the papers of Isaac Newton
				and his contemporaries. Cambridge University Library has very strong
				collections in the history of science. In addition to our Newton
				collections, the Library holds the papers of, among many other
				famous scientists, Charles Darwin, Lord Kelvin, Adam Sedgwick, J.J.
				Thomson, Ernest Rutherford, James Clerk Maxwell and Sir George
				Gabriel Stokes. The Library holds the archives of Cambridge's famous
				Cavendish Laboratory and is also the repository of the Royal
				Greenwich Observatory archives, which includes the papers of the
				Astronomers Royal and the Board of Longitude.
			</p>

			<p>
				In addition to our major collections relating to faith and science,
				we intend to make other treasures from the Library available within
				the Cambridge Digital Library. Wherever possible we will seek to
				enhance our digital collections by aligning them with scholarly
				research. Our initial release of content, the Newton Papers, is a
				good example. We have collaborated with the <a
					href="http://www.newtonproject.sussex.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Newton
					Project</a> to provide transcriptions alongside our images of Newton's
				manuscripts.
			</p>
			<p>Another goal is to make content from the Digital Library
				freely available for use within teaching and research. Copyright and
				licensing will not always permit this, but where it does we hope to
				provide good quality images and texts for download and reuse.</p>
			<p>
				We have plans to add much more content and functionality during 2012
				and 2013, but hope you will find the selection of works we're
				already included stimulating and the website easy to use. If you
				have any questions or suggestions, please <a
					href="mailto:foundations@lib.cam.ac.uk">let us know</a>.
