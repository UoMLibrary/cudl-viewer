				<p>Over the course of six centuries the Cambridge University
					Library's collections have grown from a few dozen volumes into one
					of the world's great libraries, with an extraordinary accumulation
					of books, maps, manuscripts and journals. These cover conceivable
					every aspect of human endeavour, spanning millennia and most of the
					world's cultural traditions. While parts of the Library's
					collections have already been published in print, microfilm and
					digital formats, we are now building a substantial online resource
					so that our collections can be much more accessible to students,
					researchers and the wider public.</p>
				<p>We have called the first phase of our work on the Cambridge
					Digital Library the Foundations Project, which will run from
					2010-13 and has been made possible through a lead gift of Â£1.5m by
					Dr Leonard Polonsky. This generous support will enable the Library
					to develop its technical infrastructure and create significant
					content in the areas of faith and science - two areas of particular
					strength within our collections.</p>

				<h4>Foundations of Faith</h4>
				<p>Foundations of Faith, will include important works from many
					religious traditions, particularly Judaism, Islam, Christianity and
					Buddhism. The Library's faith collections are breathtaking. They
					include some of the oldest and most significant Qur'ans ever to be
					uncovered, as well as an Eighth Century copy of Surat al-Anfal. The
					Library holds the world's largest and most important collection of
					Jewish Genizah materials, including the Taylor-Schechter Genizah
					Collection - 193,000 fragments of manuscripts considered by many to
					be as significant as the Dead Sea Scrolls. Our Christian holdings
					include the Codex Bezae Cantabrigiensis, one of the most important
					New Testament manuscripts, and the Book of Dear and Book of Cerne.

				<h4>Foundations of Science</h4>
				<p>Foundations of Science - expand [Newton and contemporaries,
					Longitude, Maxwell, Kelvin, Darwin, Rutherford. Newton collection
					is beginning etc.]</p>
