		<p>Diaries and journals can be among the most intimate and
			revealing of texts, offering accounts of their authors' lives with
			minimal literary artifice or mediation. Considered as physical
			objects, too, they accrue the fascination of having travelled with
			the writer through the events described in their pages. The notebooks
			kept by the soldier-poet Siegfried Sassoon (1886-1967) during his
			service in the British Army in the First World War are among the most
			remarkable documents of their kind, and provide an extraordinary
			insight into his participation in one of the defining conflicts of
			European history.</p>


		<p>Cambridge University Library holds the world's richest
			assemblage of Sassoon's manuscripts and archival papers. Accumulated
			from various sources over the course of several decades, the
			collection was magnificently augmented in 2009 with the acquisition
			of the papers formerly retained in the possession of Sassoon's only
			child, George. A gifted diarist, Sassoon kept a journal for most of
			his life, and the papers include a run stretching from 1905 to 1959.
			At the heart of this series are the war diaries, a fascinating
			resource for the study of the literature of the First World War which
			enables a fresh analysis of Sassoon's experience of the catastrophic
			war which influenced him profoundly.</p>


		<p>Born at Weirleigh, near Matfield in Kent, Sassoon read Law at
			Clare College, Cambridge, but left without taking a degree.
			Sufficiently wealthy not to need to work, he adopted a life of
			sporting leisure and bookish versifying until the outbreak of war
			propelled him into the role of soldier-poet. Sassoon enlisted as a
			trooper in the Sussex Yeomanry on 4 August 1914, but later took a
			commission in the Royal Welch Fusiliers. Despatched to France towards
			the end of 1915, he served with conspicuous physical courage, being
			awarded the Military Cross in June 1916 for recovering wounded men
			under fire.</p>

		<p>At the outset of war Sassoon was an ambitious and enthusiastic
			warrior, but by 1917 his first-hand knowledge of the horrors of
			trench warfare, and his anger at the needless suffering of his men
			and the ruinous waste of life which characterized battles such as the
			Somme and Arras, had led to a fundamental change of attitude. This
			development was reflected in his increasingly well-regarded poetry,
			the tone of which had grown gradually more bitter as the War
			progressed. With language incorporating soldierly slang, his poems
			began to employ sardonic or sarcastic twists, deliberately devised to
			disturb the complacency of the civilian population at home.</p>

		<p>While recuperating in Britain from a wound sustained at Arras,
			Sassoon drafted his 'Soldier's Declaration', a statement outlining
			his objections to the continuation of the War. Made as 'an act of
			wilful defiance of military authority', it detailed his refusal to
			return to duty and his belief that the war was being 'deliberately
			prolonged by those who have the power to end it'. His protest
			achieved national prominence when the statement was read in
			Parliament and printed in The Times. Instead of being
			court-martialled, however, Sassoon was despatched to Craiglockhart
			War Hospital near Edinburgh, as a patient of Dr W. H. R. Rivers.
			Under the guidance of Rivers, Sassoon resolved to atone for the
			perceived abandonment of his men by resuming his duties as an
			officer. He served in Palestine and France during the last year of
			the War, before a further wound in July 1918 brought his active
			contribution to a close.</p>

		<p>While he continued to write poetry for the rest of his life and
			wrote a series of critically acclaimed autobiographical memoirs,
			Sassoon's reputation remains primarily that of a war poet. The anger,
			compassion and bitter realism of his poems still resonate today,
			urging us still, a hundred years on, to 'swear by the slain of the
			War that you'll never forget'.</p>

			This digitised collection makes available online for the first time
			23 of Sassoon's journals from the years 1915-1927 and 1931-1932, and
			two poetry notebooks from 1916-1918 containing rough drafts and fair
			copies of his war poems. Unlike edited printed transcriptions, the
			digitisations allow the viewer to form a thorough sense of the nature
			of the physical documents. Sassoon wrote in a small but neat and
			legible hand, frequently using the notebooks from both ends. His war
			journals were used for a wide variety of purposes: in addition to
			making diary entries Sassoon drafted poetry, made pencil or ink
			sketches, listed of members of his battalion and their fates, made
			notes on military briefings and diagrams of trenches, listed
			locations and dates of times spent at or near the Front, noted
			quotations, and transcribed letters. The wartime notebooks were small
			enough to have been carried by Sassoon in the pocket of his Army
			tunic, and many had enclosures such as letters tucked into the outer
			cover or inner pouches; some bear tangible evidence of use in the
			trenches, from the mud on notebook <a
				href="/view/MS-ADD-09852-00001-00007/137">MS Add.9852/1/7</a> to the
			candlewax spilled on <a href="/view/MS-ADD-09852-00001-00009/27">MS
				Add.9852/1/9</a>, presumably as Sassoon sat writing in his dug-out by
			candlelight.

			The journals give a fascinating insight into daily life in the
			trenches. Sassoon records for example the first day of the Somme ('a
			sunlit picture of Hell'; <a href="/view/MS-ADD-09852-00001-00007/19">MS
				Add.9852/1/7, folios 10r-12v</a>) and the moment when he was shot by a
			sniper at the Battle of Arras (<a
				href="/view/MS-ADD-09852-00001-00010/14">MS Add.9852/1/10,
				folios 6v-9r</a>), along with manuscript drafts and fair copies of his
			'Soldier's Declaration' (<a href="/view/MS-ADD-09852-00001-00010/120">MS
				Add.9852/1/10, folio 45v-46r</a>; <a
				href="/view/MS-ADD-09852-00001-00011/24">MS Add.9852/1/11, folio
				21-23</a>). His drawings from France range from studies of towns and
			churches (<a href="/view/MS-ADD-09852-00001-00005/29">MS
				Add.9852/1/5, folio 36v</a>; <a href="/view/MS-ADD-09852-00001-00009/18">MS
				Add.9852/1/9, folio 8v</a>) to a psychological profile of 'the soul of
			an officer' (<a href="/view/MS-ADD-09852-00001-00007/7">MS
				Add.9852/1/7, folio 3r</a>). The poems include previously unpublished
			material along with early drafts of some of his best known works,
			including an early version of 'The Dug-Out' with an additional,
			excised verse: <a href="/view/MS-ADD-09852-00006-00002/159">MS
				Add.9852/6/2, folio 76r</a>).
