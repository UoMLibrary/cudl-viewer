		<p>From the earliest years of the Christian Church, the concept of
			‘Christ the Word of God made flesh’ inevitably found a parallel in
			the written word of the Gospels and the teaching of the Apostles.
			These Greek texts recounting the Life and teachings of Jesus (the New
			Testament) supplemented the existing Hebrew Scriptures (the Old
			Testament). Our oldest and most significant manuscript book, the
			Codex Bezae (late 4th or early 5th century CE), reflects this
			consuming interest. A bilingual New Testament, with a Greek text and
			a Latin translation on facing pages, it provides a valuable insight
			into the reception of the Gospels and Acts in the western Christian
			tradition.</p>
		<p>Biblical manuscripts of all kinds were constantly acquired by
			the University Library from its early years, whether complete or
			largely complete texts of the Scriptures, or smaller compilations
			such as Gospel books for private or liturgical use, exemplified by
			the Book of Deer, a Scottish pocket Gospel book generally dated to
			the first half of the tenth century. This emphasis on the texts of
			the scriptures reflects Cambridge's historic position as a centre of
			Christian scholarship.</p>
		<p>Alongside these biblical manuscripts developed liturgical
			texts, containing increasingly elaborate orders to direct the
			services of the Church. The Library’s collections, built up largely
			from works rescued by interested scholars and benefactors during the
			religious upheavals of the sixteenth century, show the rich variety
			of forms of liturgy throughout the Middle Ages both in this country
			and elsewhere in Europe. Some are magnificently decorated, others
			more utilitarian. The benedictional of Robert de Clercq, Abbot of Ter
			Duinen in Northern Flanders between 1519 and 1557, is a personally
			commissioned book of services and ceremonies specifically to be
			performed by a Cistercian abbot, and was illuminated by the Flemish
			artist Simon Bening.</p>
		<p>Lay people and clergy alike also acquired books for private
			use, of which the most famous are Psalters and Books of Hours, often
			finely embellished, and varying in the details of their content
			according to their place of origin. They reflected the personal
			wealth as well as the piety of their owners, while Royalty
			commissioned sumptuous books for private reading from the best court
			artists of the day, here exemplified in the unique Life of St Edward
			the Confessor (c. 1250–60) which opens a window onto court life two
			centuries after the saint’s death.</p>
		<p>Throughout the Christian period scholars and clergy have
			written works of theology and commentaries in which they explored and
			debated the Church’s doctrines and the Scriptures. In doing so they
			have touched on other areas such as philosophy and history, and they
			continue to do so today.</p>
		<p>In this selection we present some of our finest Christian
			manuscripts and early printed books, spanning over 1000 years of
			worship and debate and reflecting both Church ceremonial and private
			devotion.</p>
