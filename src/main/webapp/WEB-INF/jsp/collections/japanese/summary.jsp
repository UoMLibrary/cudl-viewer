		<p>Japan possesses an exceptionally rich heritage of written culture founded in its long literary tradition and history of paper production, and in its connections with the civilizations of neighbouring China and Korea, including the traditions of both Buddhism and Confucianism. Cambridge University Library has extremely important holdings of early Japanese books in the form of the Aston, Satow and von Siebold Collections.  William George Aston (1841-1911), Ernest Mason Satow (1843-1929) and Heinrich von Siebold (1852-1908) were great pioneers of Japanese studies.  Both Aston and Satow had served as British consular/diplomatic staff in Japan, while Heinrich von Siebold (the second son of Philipp Franz von Siebold) worked as an antiquary, collector and translator. </p>
		
		
		<p>At the beginning of Japan's modern period (around 1854 onward), these pioneer Japanologists had access to a well-developed and rich printing culture, which had existed in Japan since the early modern period (Edo period, 1600-1867).  In addition, there was an abundance of traditional Japanese books,  which were relatively cheap when Western scholars first started to collect them. Cambridge University Library received most of its early Japanese books in 1911-1913, amounting to more than 2,500 items.  In 1911, 721 Japanese books were presented from Heinrich von Siebold's collection, and later that same year, a large amount of Aston's Japanese books were acquired by the library, including Satow's books, for the sum of £250.  Satow himself presented 371 volumes in 1912 and another 62 volumes in 1913.</p>
		
		<p>There are two distinctive features in the Library's collection of early Japanese books.  Firstly, our collection represents a wide range of the various aspects of early Japanese learning, although Buddhism was predominant in the earlier materials we received.  Secondly, our collection contains excellent samples of Japan’s early printing culture, including Hyakumantō darani (one of the earliest printing materials), Kōya-ban (books published at Mount Kōya), kokatsuji-ban (early movable type printing edition), Saga-bon (luxury editions), seihan (woodblock printing edition) and mokkatsuji-ban (wooden movable type printing edition).  Together with notable book-form manuscripts, there are important and interesting scrolls (kansu-bon in Japanese).  Many of our manuscripts and woodblock printed materials contain simple or elaborate illustrations of historical significance.</p>
		
		<p>With the help of a generous donation by Professor Mikiko Ishii, we have been very fortunate have been given the opportunity to digitise important materials from our early Japanese collections and make them available on the Cambridge Digital Library.  The descriptions for this collection are mainly derived from Hayashi Nozomu and Peter Kornicki: Early Japanese Books in Cambridge University Library: a Catalogue of the Aston, Satow and Von Siebold Collection.</p>
