		<p>The archives of the Royal Greenwich Observatory, held in
			Cambridge University Library, include the complete run of the papers
			of the Board of Longitude through the eighteenth century until its
			abolition in 1828. These papers throw a vivid light on the role of
			the British state in encouraging invention and discovery, on the
			energetic culture of technical ingenuity in the long eighteenth
			century, and on many aspects of exploration and maritime travel in
			the Pacific Ocean and the Arctic.</p>

		<p>In July 1714, an act of parliament established a large prize
			for discovery of longitude, the determination of position at sea east
			or west from a fixed meridian line. The prize varied according to the
			accuracy of the method proposed: as much as £20,000 would be awarded
			for a method accurate to within 30 nautical miles, provided a ship
			could show the method worked to this accuracy. Further sums could be
			allotted for related inventions and experiments.</p>

		<p>A group of commissioners was nominated to administer this
			scheme, including representatives from the Admiralty, the Royal
			Society, the Royal Observatory, the universities, and members of
			parliament. The first meeting recorded in the Board’s minutes took
			place in 1737, prompted by an initial trial of a sea clock made by a
			Humberside artisan John Harrison. Much subsequent work of the Board
			focused on Harrison’s case, as well as the development of a
			different, astronomical, method for determination of marine
			longitude, observation of the distance between the Moon and select
			stars and the computation of an almanac predicting lunar and stellar
			positions with high accuracy. From the 1770s, the Board’s function
			changed and expanded: its members discussed the improvement of clock
			design, the performance of a range of navigational and astronomical
			instruments, and a wide range of schemes for maritime calculations,
			magnetic methods, and the manufacture of better sea charts. A large
			range of technical projects of variable practicality was sent to the
			Board for their judgment. It also played a major role in plans for
			voyages by James Cook and his successors into the Pacific in the
			1770s and into the Arctic in the opening decades of the nineteenth
			century. In 1828 many of the Board’s functions were transferred to
			other bodies and it was abolished.</p>

		<p>A project funded by AHRC based at Cambridge University and the
			National Maritime Museum, Greenwich, is studying and analyzing these
			papers and their significance. For an introduction to the project

		<p>The papers of the Board of Longitude were systematically
			gathered and catalogued at the Royal Greenwich Observatory, and
			passed to the University Library Cambridge when the Observatory’s
			papers were transferred there in 1990. This is an initial selection
			of these papers prior to a larger release in July 2013. This
			selection includes the confirmed minutes (RGO 14/5) of the Board from
			1737 until 1779, which include details of dramatic debates about
			Harrison’s claims, the development of the lunar method, expeditions
			into the Pacific ocean, and a wide range of other instrumental,
			maritime and astronomical schemes. Selected here also is the log book
			kept by the astronomer William Wales (RGO 14/58) during the
			celebrated Pacific voyage under the command of James Cook in
			1772-1775, the first voyage to cross the Antarctic circle, as well as
			visiting Tahiti, Fiji, Vanuatu and many other Oceanic islands.
			Accompanying this log book is a remarkable collection of letters (RGO
			14/68) about astronomical and navigational observations performed
			during the later eighteenth and early nineteenth century voyages,
			including reports by Wales, George Vancouver, Matthew Flinders and
			related Pacific and Arctic expeditions.</p>
