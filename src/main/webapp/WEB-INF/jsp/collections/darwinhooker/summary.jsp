		<p>Cambridge University Library houses the world's largest and
			most significant collection of the personal papers of Charles Robert
			Darwin (1809-1882), the British naturalist who was the first fully to
			articulate a theory of how all living things have evolved from a
			common ancestor. The single largest category of material in the
			Darwin archive, however, is not his experiment notes or theoretical
			notebooks but letters: more than 9,000 of the 15,000 letters Darwin is
			known to have written and received in his lifetime are in the
			Cambridge collection. It was largely through letters that Darwin
			gathered the data that first allowed him to develop his theories, and
			later to illustrate his arguments, and it was through discussion in
			letters that he honed his ideas and built strategic relationships
			with colleagues and supporters: they are an integral part of Darwin's
			scientific legacy.</p>
		<p>Darwin corresponded with around 2,000 people from all around the
			world and all walks of life. His correspondents included other
			leading scientists and thinkers, such as the geologist Charles Lyell,
			the philosopher Herbert Spencer, the zoologist Thomas Henry Huxley,
			and the other man whose name is linked to species theory, Alfred
			Russel Wallace. No single set of letters was more important to
			Darwin, however, or is more important now, than those exchanged with
			his closest friend, the botanist Joseph Dalton Hooker (1817-1911). At
			around 10% of Darwin's surviving correspondence, the 1,200 letters
			published here provide a structure within which all the other letters
			can be explored. They are a connecting thread that spans forty years
			of Darwin's mature working life from 1843 until his death in 1882.
			They bring into sharp focus every aspect of Darwin's scientific work
			throughout that period, and illuminate the mutual friendships he and
			Hooker shared with other scientists, but they also provide a window
			of unparalleled intimacy into the personal lives of the two men.</p>
		<p>Their correspondence began in 1843 when Hooker, just returned
			from James Clark Ross's Antarctic expedition, and already an admirer
			of the older man, was approached about working on Darwin's collection
			of plants from the <i>Beagle</i> voyage. Just the previous year Darwin had
			written out his first coherent account of the main elements of his
			species theory, and within a few months Hooker was admitted into the
			small and select group of those with whom Darwin felt able to discuss
			his emerging ideas. In perhaps his most <a href="/view/MS-DAR-00114-00003/4">famous letter of all</a>, Darwin
			wrote to Hooker in January 1844 of his growing conviction that
			species "are not ... immutable" - an admission he likened, half
			jokingly, to "confessing a murder". When Alfred Russel Wallace
			(1823-1913) sent Darwin a letter in 1858 outlining an almost
			identical theory to his own, it was Hooker, together with Charles
			Lyell, who engineered the simultaneous publication of papers by both
			men, and secured Darwin's claim to the theory of "modification
			through descent" by means of the mechanism Darwin called "natural
			selection".</p>
		<p>It was also to Hooker that Darwin, writing furiously in the
			succeeding months, sent batches of the manuscript of <i>On the Origin of
			Species</i> for comment, and Hooker continued to be a sounding board for
			successive publications.</p>
		<p>Much of the most important experimental work conducted by
			Darwin after the publication of <i>Origin</i> was on variation and
			adaptation in plants, in particular the mechanisms by which various
			plants are nourished, reproduce, and colonise. Hooker, who after ten
			years as assistant director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew,
			succeeded his father as director in 1865, was perfectly placed to
			provide Darwin with exotic species, and to help him build vital
			global networks of well-informed correspondents.</p>
		<p>Hooker was a frequent visitor to Darwin at his home in Downe,
			Kent, and became a great favourite of Darwin's children. The two men shared their
			experience of attending the birth of their children: Darwin <a href="/view/MS-DAR-00114-00121/1">advocated the use of
			chloroform</a> which he thought as "composing to oneself as well as to
			the patient". It was to Darwin that Hooker wrote just an hour after
			the <a href="/view/MS-DAR-00101-00159/1">death of his six year-old daughter, Maria</a>, knowing that his
			friend, who had lost both a ten year-old daughter and a baby son,
			would all too clearly understand his grief. Those letters are amongst
			the most poignant in the collection.</p>
		<p>Of the many hundreds of letters that passed between Darwin and
			Hooker, over 1,200 are still known to survive, and all but a handful
			are in the Cambridge Darwin archive. Darwin's son Francis
			incorporated many extracts in two published editions of his father's
			letters, in 1888 and 1902, the second of which he dedicated to Hooker
			"in remembrance of his lifelong friendship with Charles Darwin". At
			some time between those two editions, Hooker returned Darwin's
			letters to the family, retaining copies for himself; those copies now
			form part of the Hooker archive at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.
			Both sides of the original correspondence, bound into several large
			volumes, arrived in Cambridge University Library, in 1948, together
			with the bulk of the Darwin archive, following transfer of ownership
			from the Darwin family, supported by funding from The Pilgrim Trust.
		</p>
		<p>The Cambridge Digital Library, and the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/">
			Darwin Correspondence Project</a>, are very pleased to be able to publish images of almost the
			entire correspondence between Charles Darwin and Joseph Hooker,
			together with transcriptions of more than 1,000 of their letters.
			These are being published simultaneously through CUDL and on the
			<a target="_blank" href="http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/">The
			Darwin Correspondence Project website</a>.</p>
		<p>It is because of the vital importance of the letters to a full
			understanding of Darwin’s life and work that the University Library
			is host to the Darwin Correspondence Project. The Project exists to
			research and publish all of Darwin's surviving letters, reuniting
			those in the Library’s collection with others from collections around
			the world. The letters not only provide an invaluable insight into
			Darwin's mind throughout his working life, but also offer modern
			readers of all ages an engaging and accessible route into his
			published writings.</p>
		<p>Transcripts of Darwin's letters are normally made available
			online four years after publication in <a target="_blank" href="
			http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/the-correspondence"><i>The Correspondence of Charles
			Darwin</i></a>. We are grateful to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cambridge.org/gb/knowledge/series/series_display/item5692679/?site_locale=en_GB">
			Cambridge University Press</a> for allowing us
			to make available here all the texts of the Darwin-Hooker
			correspondence so far published.</p>
		<p>We are also grateful to the Darwin family for permission to
			publish, and for their continuing support of both Cambridge
			University Library and the Darwin Correspondence Project.</p>
		<p>Digitisation of the letters has been made possible by a
			National Science Foundation grant to the Darwin Correspondence
			Project, through the American Council of Learned Societies.</p>
