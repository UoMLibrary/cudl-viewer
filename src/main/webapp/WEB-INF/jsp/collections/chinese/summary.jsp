		<p>Cambridge University Library acquired its first Chinese book in 1632
as part of the collection of the <a href="http://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/mulu/bucks.html">Duke
of Buckingham</a>, but the first substantial holdings of Chinese books
came with the donation of 4,304 volumes by <a
href="http://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/mulu/wadebio.html">Sir Thomas Wade (1818-1895)</a>, first
Professor of Chinese in the University from 1888 until his death. The
Wade Collection, assembled during forty years' residence in China,
including ten years as British Minister at Peking, is particularly
strong in the areas of history, law and diplomacy, but also contains
several rare and unique items, notably materials relating to the
mid-19th century Taiping Rebellion, some of which are shown here.
</p>


<p>Significant additions to the Library's Chinese holdings came in the
years immediately following the Second World War. They included books
formerly belonging to, among others, Sir James Haldane Stewart
Lockhart (1858-1937), Ernest Alabaster (1872-1950), Arthur Christopher
Moule (1873-1957), Professor of Chinese 1933-38, and Gustav Haloun
(1898-1951), Professor of Chinese from 1938 until his death.</p>


<p>Microfilms of <a href="http://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/mulu/a11063.html">2,715 rare titles</a>
from the National Library of China in Peking and of the complete set
of Chinese materials from Tun-huang now held by the British Library,
the Biblioth&#232;que Nationale in Paris and the National Library of
China were also acquired.</p>

<p>An important bequest was received in 1952 by the will of Lionel
Charles Hopkins (1854-1952), comprising his celebrated collection of
over 800 <a href= "http://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/mulu/bones.html">Chinese inscribed oracle
bones</a>, more than three thousand years old and by far the oldest
documents in the Library.</p>

<p>In 1949 Professor Haloun travelled to China and purchased over 10,000
volumes with a grant from the British Government. Important gifts were
obtained from China through the mediation of Dr. Joseph Needham
(1900-95)</A>. Professors Haloun and Piet van der Loon (1920-2002)
drew up the special <a href="http://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/mulu/class.html">classification
scheme for Chinese books</a> used in the Library, and systematic
purchasing of new publications from mainland China (whenever
possible), Hong Kong and Taiwan continued under their guidance.
</a>


<p>The Chinese collections now comprise about half a million individual
titles, including monographs, reprinted materials such as manuscripts
from Dunhuang, Huizhou, etc., archival documents and epigraphical
rubbings, 200,000 <a
href="http://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/deptserv/chinese/chinadigitallibrary.html">Chinese
e-books</a> (donated by Premier Wan Jiabao in 2009), 5,000 Chinese
e-serials and 3,500 Chinese microfilm reels. Over 400,000 titles are
included in some 2,000 <a href="http://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/mulu/congshu.html">cong shu</a>.
About 3,000 Chinese printed serial titles are held in Cambridge
libraries.</p>

<p>The items displayed here show the temporal range, diversity of media
and variety of subject-matter contained within the Chinese
collections, from the oracle bones (the oldest documents in the
Library), to unique manuscripts and printed books, historical documents
and epigraphical rubbings.</p>
