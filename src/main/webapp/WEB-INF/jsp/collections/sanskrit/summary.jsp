		<p>The history of South Asian studies at the University of
			Cambridge goes hand in hand with the history of its collections of
			South Asian manuscripts. In the late 19th century the Library began
			to acquire Sanskrit manuscripts collected in Nepal and India on the
			initiative of the Cambridge Sanskritist Edward B. Cowell and his
			successor Cecil Bendall. The collaboration of other scholars such as
			William Rhys-Davids, Georg Bühler, Martin Haug, as well as of other
			professionals, enriched the collections with manuscripts hailing from
			different regions of the South Asian subcontinent and written in a
			wide range of languages, from Middle Indian (Pali and Prakrit) to
			Dravidian (such as Tamil and Malayalam).</p>

		<p>While the greatest part of collection had thus been constituted
			by 1900, the acquisitions continued through donation or purchase
			throughout the 20th century. However, despite an early effort by
			Bendall, who in 1883 published a catalogue of Buddhist Sanskrit
			manuscripts in the University Library including 248 items, until now
			the collections have remained uncatalogued and therefore scarcely
			accessible to the scholars of pre-modern South Asia and virtually
			unknown to the general public.</p>
		<p>Now the AHRC-funded project “The intellectual and religious
			traditions of South Asia as seen through the Sanskrit manuscript
			collections of the University Library, Cambridge” has begun a
			systematic investigation aiming at cataloguing and digitising all the
			holdings. These comprise more than 1600 works in Sanskrit, Prakrit,
			Pali, Tamil and other ancient and medieval South Asian languages,
			produced during a time span of more than 1000 years, and written in
			over a dozen scripts and on different writing materials, such as
			paper, palm-leaf and birch-bark.</p>
		<p>Along with doctrinal, exegetical and ritual works issued from
			the many religious traditions of South Asia - from the Vedic religion
			to devotional Hinduism and Tantrism, from Theravāda to Mahāyāna and
			Tantric Buddhism, to Jainism - the Library’s holdings also include
			texts on a variety of “secular” topics, ranging from works of poetry
			and drama to treatises on philosophy, mathematics, grammar,
			astronomy, law, eroticism, medicine, archery, horse breeding, etc.</p>
		<p>It is a wealth of cultural and historical information on South
			Asia of great potential significance for contemporary scholarship,
			which will be gradually made available through the Digital Library.</p>
