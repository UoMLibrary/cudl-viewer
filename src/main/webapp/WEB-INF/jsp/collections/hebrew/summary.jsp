		<p>For over five hundred years Cambridge University has been
			building up one of the world’s most important collections of Hebrew
			manuscripts. The University Library holds significant numbers of
			Bibles and biblical and talmudic commentaries, along with important
			halakhic, liturgical, poetic, philosophical, kabbalistic and
			scientific manuscripts. Chief among the treasures are the famous Nash
			Papyrus, one of the earliest known manuscripts containing the words
			of the Hebrew Bible and an artefact that continues to excite debate
			more than a hundred years after its discovery, and the Cambridge
			Mishnah, one of only three complete manuscript codices of this
			central text of Jewish law.</p>
		<p>The acquisition of the first Hebrew manuscripts probably
			originated from local pre-expulsion Jewish communities; later,
			Christian clerics gave an impetus to the study of Hebrew for
			scholarly purposes. A sounder basis for Hebrew study grew in the
			University from the 16th century, after the Regius Professorship in
			Hebrew was founded in 1540, and many significant manuscript
			collections came from Cambridge scholars who collected texts for
			their own use.</p>
		<p>Notable collectors from early times include the Arabist,
			Abraham Whelock (who was the first Professor of Arabic before being
			appointed University Librarian in 1629) whose efforts brought about
			significant additions to both the Arabic and Hebrew collections,
			including the transfer to Cambridge of the Dutch orientalist Thomas
			van Erpe’s (Erpenius) collection, which contained thirteen Hebrew
			manuscripts and one written in Judaeo-Arabic.</p>
		<p>A second important collection was that of Isaac Faraji (Pragi)
			whose collection of ten Hebrew manuscripts was purchased by John
			Selden, the jurist and scholar and a name more often associated with
			the Bodleian. He was responsible for the acquisition of the
			collection from the London bookseller George Thomason in 1648.</p>
		<p>More manuscripts and books came to the Library in the 17th
			century from the collections of the scholars Richard Holdsworth
			(Master of Emmanuel College), Henry Lucas and Edmund Castell
			(1606–1685), the compiler of the ‘Lexicon Heptaglotton’ who left
			nineteen Hebrew manuscripts to the Library. The acquisition by the
			Library of the Royal Collection of George I in 1715 brought with it a
			small number of Hebrew volumes including a 14th-century Bible from
			Spain.</p>
		<p>In the early 19th century the missionary Claudius Buchanan
			(1766–1815) presented twenty-one Hebrew manuscripts, some relating to
			Jewish communities in South India. During the late 19th century, when
			the post of Librarian was held by Henry Bradshaw and the Bible
			scholar William Robertson Smith, the collections of Hebrew
			manuscripts were greatly increased.</p>
		<p>Under the influence of the Dr Solomon Schiller-Szinessy, who
			exercised a formative influence on 19th-century Hebrew studies in
			Cambridge, many manuscripts were purchased from dealers in
			Continental Europe such as Samuel Schonblum, Fischl Hirsch and
			Lipschutz.</p>

		<p>Catalogues of the Hebrew manuscript collections have been made
			over the years by several scholars including Solomon
			Schiller-Szinessy and Herbert Loewe (1882–1940). In 1975
			responsibility for this task was taken over by Stefan and Shulamit
			Reif whose catalogue of the complete collection, incorporating much
			of the work from earlier listings, was published in 1997.</p>
