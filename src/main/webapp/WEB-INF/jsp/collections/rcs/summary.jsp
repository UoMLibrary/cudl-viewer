		<p>The <a href="http://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/collections/departments/royal-commonwealth-society">Royal Commonwealth Society (RCS) Library collections</a> are a treasure-trove of information, pictorial and written, print and manuscript, focussing on the Commonwealth and Britain's former colonial territories, comprising over 300,000 printed items, about 800 archival collections (including manuscript diaries, correspondence, pictures, cine films, scrapbooks and newspaper cuttings) and over 120,000 photographs.  Excitingly, geographical coverage often extends beyond the Commonwealth and includes the former territories of other European countries such as Thailand and Vietnam, as well as China, Korea and Japan, as illustrated in the photographs of Sir Henry Norman.  For more information on the history of the RCS Library, please see our <a href="http://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/rcs_photo_project/history1.html">brief guide</a>.</p>
