		<p>Cambridge University Library's collection of Islamic
			manuscripts dates from the origins of Arabic scholarship in Cambridge
			in the 1630s when the University founded a Professorship in Arabic
			and William Bedwell donated a Qur'an to the Library. Since that time
			the collection has grown in size and diversity to over 5,000 works,
			including the collections of Thomas Erpenius, J.L.Burckhardt,
			E.H.Palmer and E.G. Browne. These manuscripts shed light on many
			aspects of the Islamic world, its beliefs and learning.</p>

		<p>
			The collection was further enriched over the centuries through the
			activities of scholarly collectors and skilled librarians, adding
			more depth to the already impressive range of manuscripts. Yet this
			extraordinary collection has remained relatively unknown outside
			Cambridge. Now we hope to draw better attention to its treasures
			through cataloguing and digitisation. We have collaborated with the
			Bodleian at Oxford and other research libraries to provide an <a
				target="_blank" href="http://www.fihrist.org.uk/">online
				catalogue of the collection</a>. We will be offering a selection of
			digitised manuscripts through the Foundations project and will seek
			funding for further digitisation.
		</p>

		<p>In this selection, we present several examples of Qur'anic
		manuscripts, including a <a href="/view/MS-NN-00003-00075">complete and beautifully illustrated Qur'an</a>
		and a number of very <a href="/view/MS-ADD-01116/">early fragments</a> dating back to the first centuries
		of the Islamic calendar. From the rich literature encompassing
		the Islamic tradition we have chosen the only extant copy of <a href="/view/MS-ADD-03651/">Kitāb al-tawḥīd</a>,
		the famous theological work by by al-Maturidi, alongside works on <a href="/view/MS-QQ-00054/">science</a>
		and some richly illustrated examples of <a href="/view/MS-ADD-00269/">Persian Literature</a>.</p>
