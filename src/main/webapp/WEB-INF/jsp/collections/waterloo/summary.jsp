		<p>The Battle of Waterloo was fought on Sunday 18 June 1815, ten
			miles south of Brussels in what was then the Kingdom of the
			Netherlands. It was the climactic engagement of a campaign that
			pitted an invading French army under Napoleon Bonaparte against a
			combined force of Allied troops—chiefly British, Netherlandish and
			Hanoverian—commanded by the Duke of Wellington and a Prussian army
			led by Gebhard von Blücher. The French were routed, and the warfare
			that had plagued Europe for more than two decades was definitively
			ended: there were to be no hostilities on such a scale on the
			continent until the outbreak of the First World War in 1914. Through
			its impact on the politics and power-relationships of a Europe
			approaching the height of its worldwide influence, the outcome of
			Waterloo remains significant to this day.</p>

		<p>After the French Revolution of 1789, Europe had been embroiled
			in twenty-five years of near-continuous war. Early attempts to subdue
			revolutionary France gave way to a series of conflicts in which
			successive coalitions of European powers struggled to deal with the
			expansionist ambitions of Napoleon, Emperor of the French from 1804.
			Following the failure of his invasion of Russia in 1812, Napoleon’s
			defeat at the Battle of Leipzig in 1813 left France itself
			vulnerable. Unable to force his enemies back, the Emperor abdicated
			in April 1814 and went into exile on the Mediterranean island of
			Elba. But late in February 1815, in a characteristic high-stakes
			gamble, Napoleon sailed for France at the head of a thousand
			soldiers. In just twenty-three days, he returned to Paris and took
			back the crown.</p>

		<p>Russia, Austria, Prussia, Britain and their allies formed a new
			coalition, pledging to put vast armies in the field to force Napoleon
			from his throne. Napoleon realised that his best chance lay in
			striking decisively before weight of numbers could be brought to
			bear, and resolved to engage enemy forces garrisoned in the
			Netherlands. 128,000 strong, the French Armée du Nord crossed the
			frontier on 15 June. After two smaller engagements on 16 June, battle
			was joined at Waterloo on 18 June.</p>

		<p>On both sides, objectives were simple. Napoleon sought to break
			the Allied resistance before the Prussians could arrive on the field.
			Wellington sought to hold ground and bleed the enemy of precious
			troops. Much of the Prussian army was marching towards Napoleon’s
			right flank. The battle at Waterloo was, as Wellington said the next
			day, ‘the nearest run thing you ever saw in your life’. At five
			o’clock the Prussians were threatening French positions at
			Plancenoit. Around six o’clock, with the fall of Wellington’s central
			strongpoint, the farmhouse of La Haye Sainte, the French were
			winning. But two hours later, after the failure of Napoleon’s final
			assault, the Duke was able to order a general advance against a
			suddenly demoralised enemy: the French army broke and was driven from
			the field. The Coalition armies pursued Napoleon into France, and he
			abdicated for a final time on 22 June.</p>

		<p>The battle’s importance was fully recognised by the generations
			which came after it. From the very first moment after the fighting
			stopped, soldiers and civilians alike wanted to put their experiences
			and emotions into words. The direct, first-hand writings of those involved
			in the battle were complemented by the works
			of literary authors. Both Byron and Tennyson described the battle as
			an ‘earthquake’, and Victor Hugo called it ‘the hinge of the
			nineteenth century’: ‘On that day, the perspective of the human race
			was changed’. For the British, Waterloo established a place in the
			national imagination by which it seemed to underwrite the country’s
			advance to global pre-eminence as the century progressed. Given the
			widespread fascination with the battle, Waterloo soon became a
			fashionable destination for travellers: many wanted to be ‘an
			eye-witness of the very spot’ where history had been made.</p>

		<p>The human cost of the Waterloo campaign for those who fought in
			it is impossible to quantify accurately, but the combined casualties
			of the campaign have been tentatively estimated at over 100,000 men
			killed, wounded and missing (including deserters). Large numbers of
			the wounded on both sides at Waterloo remained untreated until the
			days following the battle, and many died after protracted suffering.
			The vast majority of those killed in the battle were buried or burned
			on the field.</p>

		<p>For the commanding officers, Waterloo had very different
			outcomes. Blücher was 72 at the time of the battle: having been
			raised to the rank of Prince after the peace of 1814, he returned to
			his estate in Silesia and died there in 1819. Wellington, after
			serving as Commander-in-Chief of the Allied occupation force in
			France, went into politics and was briefly Prime Minister from 1828
			to 1830. He died in 1852, the quintessential British hero to many,
			although a symbol of political regression to others. It is Napoleon’s
			reputation around which most controversy still clings. Exiled to St
			Helena, he died and was buried there in 1821, but his remains were
			repatriated to France in 1840 and entombed in splendour at Les
			Invalides in Paris. Yet appreciation of his qualities as a military
			commander cannot erase his despotism and warmongering as a statesman:
			‘the enemy and disturber of the world’, as his adversaries styled
			him. Lord Acton’s famous judgement on power and corruption may be
			applied to Napoleon Bonaparte with particular force: ‘Great men are
			almost always bad men’.</p>
			
		<p>Although Cambridge University Library has never set out to assemble a specific,
		single collection relating to Waterloo, the strength and breadth of our accessioning
		activity mean that over the course of two hundred years we have amassed a rich and
		fascinating variety of written records, maps and book arts relating to the battle
		and the era in which it played so significant a part. To mark the bicentenary of Waterloo,
		this Digital Library collection presents a sample of such material, encompassing military drill-books,
		manuscript letters, hand-coloured engravings, battlefield plans, printed mementos and tourist reminiscences.</p>
