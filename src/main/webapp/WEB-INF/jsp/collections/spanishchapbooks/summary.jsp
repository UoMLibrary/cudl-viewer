			What sort of holdings should a library have? This question could well
			have been raised when Cambridge University Library and the British
			Library acquired items for their extensive holdings of ephemeral
			literature printed in Spain. This material, not obviously 'serious'
			or 'academic', and recently termed 'no-books' by a French colleague,
			was assiduously collected for the two libraries by a small number of
			enthusiasts. It is now available to all, as a digital, searchable
			collection, via the web-pages of the CUL and BL. Usually referred to
			in English as chap-books, and in Spanish as <i>sueltos</i>, or <i>pliegos
				sueltos</i> (loose leaves or folded loose leaves), these predecessors of
			the yellow press provide a fascinating bird's eye view of popular
			culture from the eighteenth century onwards. Cambridge University
			Library provided some 2,000 <i>sueltos</i>, including nearly 200
			poster-sized <i>aleluyas</i>, which typically have 48 illustrations
			and accompanying text in couplets, and some 2,500 19 and late 18
			century <i>sueltos</i> from the British Library. Many researchers
			have been unaware of the rich holdings these libraries have of this
			material.
		</p>

		<p>
			Although they are numerous, the <i>sueltos</i> have received
			relatively little attention, not least because understanding this
			field as a whole has been difficult. Even where catalogue entries
			existed, they were insufficient for researchers to scan the material
			for themes or characteristics, or to view detail of the corpus
			against the background of the larger whole. Digitising and
			cataloguing the <i>sueltos</i> has contributed clearly to the
			stewardship and conservation of this material. But more than this, it
			opens the way for a new wave of activity. We can 'read all about it':
			we can read of gory crimes, heroic criminals, and wayward citizens at
			our pleasure. Not only can we 'read all about it', but all can
			participate in the reading. The accessibility of this material under
			an open license enables people to see and use these fascinating items
			from all over the world, at any point where internet access is
			available to the webpages of CUL or BL. Meanwhile, the catalogue
			makes it much easier to work with these sources, and to compare them
			with the material held in other libraries.
		</p>

		<p>The collection was catalogued and digitised for the AHRC-funded
			project 'Wrongdoing in Spain 1800-1936: Realities, Representations,
			Reactions' (2011-2014). The project focused on particular aspects of
			the cultural representation of wrongdoing and its relation (or lack
			of it) to historical realities at the time of production. The
			material in this collection provides a unique base for tracking such
			interests within the field of popular literature, and in addition
			will enable the exploration of other themes, not just that of
			'Wrongdoing'.</p>

		<p>
			Two major questions arise when looking at this material. Firstly, it
			makes us think about right and wrong. Considering it in the context
			of 'wrongdoing', we are stimulated to think just what is involved in
			such a flexible term (even though we probably hear it used on the
			radio on a daily basis). The concept of 'wrongdoing' encompasses not
			just crime, but takes us into the area of the moral understanding of
			right and wrong, the transgression of social norms, and religious
			concepts of sin. The <i>sueltos</i> open up the potential for
			thinking about this broad topic, and to consider the social and
			cultural responses it has elicited over time. Such responses include
			anxiety, the desire for retribution, and the ways in which the reader
			or spectator might identify with (or decide to stand apart from)
			perpetrators or victims. Most of all it raises the question of why we
			are interested in a type of culture that tends to specialize in the
			shocking or the unsavoury, or why, as cultural consumers, we take a
			type of pleasure in the wrongdoing of others.
		</p>

		<p>
			There is a second major question: how far does this material
			represent what is 'real', and how far does it consist of the work of
			the imagination? There is a distinct lack of information about the
			historical reality (or otherwise) of the people and events who appear
			in the <i>sueltos</i>. Even when they are given names and place of
			birth, and even when dates are given for the events recounted, such
			information is no guarantee of historical reality. But they
			constitute a cultural reality: this is what people read about. This
			is what they had instead of cheap newspapers, or reality TV. As with
			the media today, images are used to attract attention. The striking
			image shown here, of a collection of animals attacking a person (sex
			unclear), holds our attention because of its graphic and grisly
			detail. It reflects what will be the moral punchline of the story it
			accompanies, that of the 'unfortunate' Teresa, whose lack of charity
			to Christ who appeared at the door in the guise of a pauper led to
			her violent death. It would appear this story was something of an
			urban myth: but it is only possible to conclude it by having access
			to the many and somewhat varied versions of the narrative.
		</p>

		<p>
			A first glimpse of this material is available through two
			exhibitions. 'Read all about it!', where Spanish material is set
			alongside with analogous English popular material available online at
			<a href='https://exhibitions.lib.cam.ac.uk/wrongdoing/'>https://exhibitions.lib.cam.ac.uk/wrongdoing/</a>.
			Its narrative follows a type of life-cycle of wrongdoing, from
			education to (in some cases) execution. Meanwhile a <a
				href='http://tiny.cc/wrongdoing1'>Facebook gallery</a> is available
			at the British Library, 'Wrongdoing meets modernity', in which the
			focus is on evolving ideas about crime and the poor in 19th-century
			Spain, and on the idea of wrongdoing being seductive and exciting.
