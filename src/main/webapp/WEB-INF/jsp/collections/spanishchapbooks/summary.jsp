			Not quite by accident, but largely because of an interest in
			ephemeral literature printed in Spain shown by Hispanists here in the
			early twentieth century, Cambridge University Library has an
			impressive and rich collection of what a French colleague has termed
			‘no-books’. Usually referred to in English as chap-books, and in
			Spanish as <i>sueltos</i>, or <i>pliegos sueltos</i> (loose leaves or
			folded loose leaves), these predecessors of the yellow press provide
			a fascinating bird’s eye view of popular culture from the eighteenth
			century onwards.
		</p>

		<p>
			The collection presented here is a small initial selection of about
			four and a half thousand <i>sueltos</i> being catalogued and
			digitised for the AHRC-funded project ‘Wrongdoing in Spain 1800-1936:
			Realities, Representations, Reactions’. The project is focusing on
			particular aspects of the cultural representation of wrongdoing and
			its relation (or lack of it) to historical realities at the time of
			production, but the resulting collection will enable the exploration
			of other themes within this fascinating literature. Cambridge
			University Library has a collection of nearly 2000 <i>sueltos</i>,
			including nearly 200 poster-sized <i>aleluyas</i>, which typically
			have 48 illustrations and accompanying text in couplets. To this will
			be added important collections from the British Library. At both
			Cambridge and at the British Library, these collections have suffered
			in the past from a lack of attention from cataloguers, so at present
			it is difficult for researchers to scan the material for themes or
			characteristics. The consequences of digitising and cataloguing will
			open the way for a new wave of activity in relation to this material.
			Not only will digitisation of the <i>sueltos</i> be a significant
			contribution to the stewardship, conservation and enhanced
			accessibility of a body of cultural material (under an open license,
			it will be possible to see and use these fascinating items from all
			over the world, at any point where internet access is possible), but
			they will also be catalogued in a way that will make it much easier
			to work with these sources.
		</p>

		<p>
			The full range of the collection of <i>sueltos</i> is greater than
			what is covered by the term ‘wrongdoing’, and includes popular
			devotional texts, short plays and items of popular poetry. But
			‘wrongdoing’ encompasses not just crime, but moral understanding of
			right and wrong, the transgression of social norms, and religious
			concepts of sin. The <i>sueltos</i> therefore open up the potential
			for thinking about this broad topic, and to consider the social and
			cultural responses it has elicited over time. Such responses include
			anxiety, the desire for retribution, identification with perpetrators
			or victims. Most of all it raises the question of why we are
			interested in culture that indicates the shocking or the unsavoury,
			and of why we, as cultural consumers, take a type of pleasure in the
			wrongdoing of others.
		</p>

		<p>An exhibition of this material, alongside analogous popular
			material drawn from the Library's collection of English chapbooks and
			broadsides, opened April 2013. Its narrative follows a type of
			life-cycle of wrongdoing, from education about how to know right from
			wrong, through the challenges that arise as we grow up, and
			characteristically become involved in family frictions, and then
			illustrating the sorts of actions of violence and excess that can
			result. A final section focuses on the representation of
			retribution, whether divine or otherwise.</p>
