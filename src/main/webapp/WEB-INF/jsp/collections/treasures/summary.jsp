					An important goal of the Cambridge Digital Library is to
					make available substantial collections, so that researchers,
					teachers and life-long learners can explore a wide range of
					resources and uncover their own treasures. We expect the
					digitisation of our collections to enable interesting discoveries
					to be made and to open up new avenues for research. As we develop
					the digital library infrastructure we will look for ways of
					capturing and publicising new information about items held within
					the digital library.
				</p>
				<p>However, there are many items within the Library’s
					collections that already deserve highlighting. This may be because
					of their historical importance, uniqueness, beauty, fascinating
					content, or perhaps their personal associations. In this special
					collection within the Cambridge Digital Library we will draw
					together books, manuscripts and other items from across our
					collections that are especially significant. Many of them have been
					displayed in Library exhibitions in the past – now they can be
					accessed at any time, from anywhere in the world, and browsed cover
					to cover.</p>
