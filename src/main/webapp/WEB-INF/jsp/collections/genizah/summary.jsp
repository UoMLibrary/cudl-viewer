		<p>The Taylor-Schechter Cairo Genizah Collection at Cambridge
			University Library is the world's largest and most important single
			collection of medieval Jewish manuscripts. For a thousand years, the
			Jewish community of Fustat (Old Cairo), placed their left-over,
			no-longer usable manuscripts in a storeroom (genizah) of the Ben Ezra
			Synagogue, and in 1896–97 the Cambridge scholar, Dr Solomon
			Schechter, with financial help from the Mastor of St John’s College,
			Charles Taylor, arrived to examine it. He received permission from
			the Jewish community of Egypt to take away what he wanted, so he
			brought 193,000 manuscripts back to Cambridge, where they form the
			Taylor-Schechter Cairo Genizah Collection.</p>
		<p>The storeroom where the manuscripts were stored by the
			community of Fustat was a genizah: a sacred storeroom. According to
			rabbinic law, once a holy book can no longer be used (because it is
			too old, or because its text is no longer relevant) it cannot just be
			destroyed: to destroy something with the name of God is to deny God.
			So, instead, such a book must be buried or, if burial is not
			possible, placed in a genizah.</p>
		<p>At least from the early 11th century, the Jews of Fustat, one
			of the most important and richest Jewish communities of the
			Mediterranean world, reverently placed their old manuscripts in the
			Genizah. Remarkably, however, they placed not only the expected
			religious works, such as Bibles, prayer books and compendia of Jewish
			law, but also what we would regard as secular works and everyday
			documents. They placed shopping lists, butcher's bills, marriage
			documents, divorce deeds, pages from Arabic fables, works of Sufi and
			Shi'ite philosophy, medical books, magical amulets, business letters
			and accounts, and hundreds of personal letters: examples of
			practically every kind of written text can now be found in the
			Genizah Collection, and it presents an unparalleled insight into the
			medieval Jewish world of the eastern Mediterranean and Near East.</p>
