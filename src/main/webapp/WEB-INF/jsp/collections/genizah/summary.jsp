		<p>The Taylor-Schechter Cairo Genizah Collection at Cambridge
			University Library is the world's largest and most important single
			collection of medieval Jewish manuscripts. For a thousand years, the
			Jewish community of Fustat (Old Cairo), placed their worn-out books
			and other writings in a storeroom (genizah) of the Ben Ezra
			Synagogue, and in 1896–97 the Cambridge scholar, Dr Solomon
			Schechter, with financial help from the Master of St John’s College,
			Charles Taylor, arrived to examine it. He received permission from
			the Jewish community of Egypt to take away what he liked (explaining
			later, ‘I liked it all’), and he brought 193,000 manuscripts back to
			Cambridge, where they form the Taylor-Schechter Cairo Genizah
			Collection.</p>
		<p>The storeroom where the manuscripts were stored by the
			community of Fustat was a genizah, a sacred storeroom. According to
			rabbinic law (see, for instance, Mishna Shabbat 16:1), once a holy
			book can no longer be used (because it is too old, or because its
			text is no longer relevant) it cannot be destroyed or casually
			discarded: texts containing the name of God should be buried or, if
			burial is not possible, placed in a genizah.</p>
		<p>At least from the early 11th century, the Jews of Fustat, one
			of the most important and richest Jewish communities of the
			Mediterranean world, reverently placed their old texts in the
			Genizah. Remarkably, however, they placed not only the expected
			religious works, such as Bibles, prayer books and compendia of Jewish
			law, but also what we would regard as secular works and everyday
			documents: shopping lists, marriage contracts, divorce deeds, pages
			from Arabic fables, works of Sufi and Shi'ite philosophy, medical
			books, magical amulets, business letters and accounts, and hundreds
			of letters: examples of practically every kind of written text
			produced by the Jewish communities of the Near East can now be found
			in the Genizah Collection, and it presents an unparalleled insight
			into the medieval Jewish world.</p>
		<p>Alongside the T-S Collection, Cambridge University Library is
			also now the home of the Jacques Mosseri Genizah Collection.
			Assembled by the successful Cairene businessman, Jacques (Jack)
			Mosseri in the first decade of the twentieth century, these
			manuscripts were intended to remain in Egypt as part of the Jewish
			community’s cultural heritage. However, after Mosseri’s premature
			death in 1934 and his family’s subsequent departure from Egypt, his
			eponymous collection disappeared from scholarly view until the 1970s,
			when it was microfilmed by a team from the Jewish National and
			University Library. Following recent discussions with members of the
			Mosseri family, in 2006 this 7000-fragment collection came to
			Cambridge University Library on a 20-year loan. During its stay in
			Cambridge, the Mosseri Collection will be conserved and digitised,
			and a new, detailed catalogue produced.</p>
		<p>At the moment, only a selection of several thousand manuscripts
			from the Taylor-Schechter and Jacques Mosseri Collections are
			available online at this site, but eventually Cambridge Digital
			Library will present images and descriptions of every manuscript, as
			well as the Genizah items found in the Library's Or. and Add.
			Collections.</p>

			The <a href="http://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/Taylor-Schechter/"
				target="_blank">Genizah Research Unit</a> at Cambridge University
			Library is responsible for the curation, digitisation and description
			of the Genizah Collection.
