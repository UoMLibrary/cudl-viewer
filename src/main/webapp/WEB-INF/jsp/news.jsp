				We have created a new collection to gather together items being
				featured in Library exhibitions. The <a href="/collections/exhibitions">initial
					selection</a> provides a sneak preview of Spanish and English pamphlets
				appearing in our 'Wrongdoing' exhibition, which opens to the public
				on 30th April. These items will also feature in an accompanying
				exhibition website and we will link them to that site once it is
				launched later this month.

			<h4>Browse 1,200 letters between Charles Darwin and his close

			<p>
				These <a href="/collections/darwinhooker">letters</a> are a
				connecting thread that spans forty years of Darwin's mature working
				life from 1843 until his death in 1882. They bring into sharp focus
				every aspect of Darwin's scientific work throughout that period, and
				illuminate the mutual friendships he and Hooker shared with other
				scientists, but they also provide a window of unparalleled intimacy
				into the personal lives of the two men.

			<h4>Maimonides fragments and Newton's dispute with Flamsteed
				released</h4>
			<p>
				In this release we are publishing a further 8,000 Genizah fragments,
				bringing our overall total to 12,000 available on the site. The <a
					href="/collections/genizah">Cairo Genizah Collection</a> at
				Cambridge University Library is the world's largest and most
				important single collection of medieval Jewish manuscripts, and this
				selection includes three autograph texts by the greatest Jewish
				thinker of the Middle Ages, Moses Maimonides (<a
					href="/view/MS-TS-AS-00111-00164">T-S AS 111.164</a>, <a
					href="/view/MS-TS-AS-00149-00089">T-S AS 149.89</a> and <a
					href="/view/MS-MOSSERI-VIII-00024-00001">Mosseri VIII.24.1</a>)
			</p>
			<p>
				We are also releasing three Newton manuscripts - including <a
					href="/view/MS-ADD-04006">MS Add.4006</a>, which contains Newton's
				correspondence with John Flamsteed, the first Astronomer Royal. The
				correspondence touches on the dispute between Flamsteed and the
				Royal Society (of which Newton was the President) over the
				publication of Flamsteed's observations. Newton required real
				observations of the Moon's place for his theoretical work, and
				Flamsteed, who was the holder of those observations, resented
				Newton's imperious demands. In 1712 publication went ahead without
				Flamsteedâ€™s agreement, incensing the Astronomer Royal who referred
				to this as a 'villainous outrage'.

			<h4>Log book of Captain Cook's astonishing Pacific and Antarctic

			<p>
				In this release we are presenting an <a
					href="/collections/longitude">initial selection</a> of our
				Longitude collection, including papers from the astonishing Pacific
				and Antarctic voyage of James Cook in 1772-1775. The digitised
				archive of the Board of Longitude, the majority of which will be
				released in July 2013, is a major resource for the history of
				science, and throws a vivid light on the role of the British state
				in encouraging invention and discovery, on the energetic culture of
				technical ingenuity in the eighteenth century, and on many aspects
				of exploration and maritime travel in the Pacific Ocean and the
				Arctic. We are also releasing eighteen further <a
					href="/collections/newton">Newton manuscripts</a>, including
				correspondence with major figures such as Halley and Flamsteed.

			<h4>Build your own Digital Library with our Bookmarking tool</h4>
			<p>
				This release sees new bookmarking functionality which allows you to
				build your own digital collection within the Cambridge Digital
				Library. This is the first of many planned features for personal
				interaction with our material. We have also released some exciting
				new content, including two brand-new collections. Our initial
				selection of Christian Works includes a fully-transcribed
				presentation of the 4th century Biblical text the <a
					href="/view/MS-NN-00002-00041/1">Codex Bezae</a>, along with the
				earliest known Scottish manuscript, the <a

				manuscripts is the <a href="/view/MS-OR-00233/1">Nash Papyrus</a>, a
				second-century BCE fragment containing the text of the Ten
				Commandments. We have added important material to our Sanskrit and
				Islamic collections, and our Treasures collection now includes Henry
				VIII's personal copy of Erasmus' translation of Plutarch. We have
				also added over 3,000 new Genizah fragments, more than trebling the
				number of items available.

			<h4>View the Library's treasures cover to cover</h4>
			<p>
				We have added more items to the Islamic Manuscripts and Newton
				collections - including several videos explaining Newton's work and
				ideas - and have initiated two new collections: the <a
					href="/collections/genizah">Cairo Genizah collection</a> and <a
					href="/collections/treasures">Treasures of the Library</a>. Both
				these collections will grow considerably over the the next few
				months. The initial Genizah collection includes a selection of
				seventy-two manuscripts, intended to show the wide range of material
				in this fascinating collection. Among the Treasures we've added to
				the Digital Library are the <i>Codex Bezae</i>, <i>Life of St
					Edward the Confessor</i>, <i>Nuremberg Chronicle</i>, and Montaigne's
				copy of <i>Titi Lucretii Cari De rerum natura libri sex</i>. The
				last three works are featured in the current Library exhibition, <a
					target="_blank"
					href="http://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/exhibitions/shelf_lives">Shelf
					Lives</a> . Now you can view these treasures in great detail, from

				Library's Near and Middle Eastern Department. The Library's
				collection of Islamic manuscripts began in the 1630s and has since
				grown substantially in its size and diversity. It now contains more
				than 5,000 works. Our initial selection includes several important
				early Qur'ans.

			<h4>Upcoming Collections</h4>
			<p>
				In addition to the digitisation we have already planned for the
				Cambridge Digital Library, we are pleased to announce two
				externally-funded projects which will add significant content. The
				AHRC are providing funding for the cataloguing of our important
				Sanskrit manuscript collection, which includes some of the earliest
				surviving Buddhist manuscripts. Approximately 1000 of these
				manuscripts will be digitised and made available within the
				Cambridge Digital Library's Foundations of Faith collection. The
				JISC are funding the complete digitisation of the Board of Longitude
				papers, which provide a fascinating record of 18th century science
				and technology and the great voyages of discovery. This collection
				will be made available as part of the Foundations of Science
				collection and closely linked to collections held by the National
				Maritime Museum at Greenwich. Please <a
					href="mailto:foundations@lib.cam.ac.uk">contact us</a> for more
				information about these projects.
