		<p>
			We have added more items to the Islamic Manuscripts and Newton
			collections - including several videos explaining Newton's work and
			ideas - and have initiated two new collections: the <a
				href="/collections/genizah">Cairo Genizah collection</a> and <a
				href="/collections/treasures">Treasures of the Library</a>. Both
			these collections will grow considerably over the the next few
			months. The initial Genizah collection includes a selection of
			seventy-two manuscripts, intended to show the wide range of material
			in this fascinating collection. Among the Treasures we've added to
			the Digital Library are the <i>Codex Bezae</i>, <i>Life of St
				Edward the Confessor</i>, <i>Nuremberg Chronicle</i>, and Montaigne's
			copy of <i>Titi Lucretii Cari De rerum natura libri sex</i>. The last
			three works are featured in the current Library exhibition, <a
				target="_blank" href="http://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/exhibitions/shelf_lives">Shelf
				Lives</a> . Now you can view these treasures in great detail, from
			cover to cover.

		<h4>Islamic Manuscripts</h4>
		<p>
			We are pleased to announce the release of the first items within the
			Foundations of Faith collection: a selection of <a
				href="/collections/islamic">Islamic manuscripts</a> from the
			Library's Near and Middle Eastern Department. The Library's
			collection of Islamic manuscripts began in the 1630s and has since
			grown substantially in its size and diversity. It now contains more
			than 5,000 works. Our initial selection includes several important
			early Qur'ans.

		<h4>Upcoming Collections</h4>
		<p>
			In addition to the digitisation we have already planned for the
			Cambridge Digital Library, we are pleased to announce two
			externally-funded projects which will add significant content. The
			AHRC are providing funding for the cataloguing of our important
			Sanskrit manuscript collection, which includes some of the earliest
			surviving Buddhist manuscripts. Approximately 1000 of these
			manuscripts will be digitised and made available within the Cambridge
			Digital Library's Foundations of Faith collection. The JISC are
			funding the complete digitisation of the Board of Longitude papers,
			which provide a fascinating record of 18th century science and
			technology and the great voyages of discovery. This collection will
			be made available as part of the Foundations of Science collection
			and closely linked to collections held by the National Maritime
			Museum at Greenwich. Please <a
				href="mailto:foundations@lib.cam.ac.uk">contact us</a> for more
			information about these projects.
