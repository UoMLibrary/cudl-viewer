			<h4>Introducing the Cambridge Digital Library</h4>
			<p>
				Over the next two years we will be adding a lot of content and
				functionality to this website. You'll be able to explore many of the
				Library's great collections and make use of them within your
				research and learning - whether that takes place within formal
				education or is a personal pursuit. Find out more about the <a

			<h4>Dissecting a Newton notebook</h4>
			<p>Digitisation is not just a matter of placing something on a
				scanner or in front of a camera - fragile items will often require
				some conservation work before they can be safely imaged. Two of the
				notebooks in our Newton collection had been rebound a little too
				tightly in the past and needed to be carefully taken apart. Find out
				more about this process in our blog entry.</p>
