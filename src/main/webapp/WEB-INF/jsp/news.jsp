		<h4>Upcoming Collections</h4>
		<p>
			In addition to the digitisation we have already planned for the
			Cambridge Digital Library, we are pleased to announce two
			externally-funded projects which will add significant content. The
			AHRC are providing funding for the cataloguing of our important
			Sanskrit manuscript collection, which includes some of the earliest
			surviving Buddhist manuscripts. Approximately 1000 of these
			manuscripts will be digitised and made available within the Cambridge
			Digital Library's Foundations of Faith collection. The JISC are
			funding the complete digitisation of the Board of Longitude papers,
			which provide a fascinating record of 18th century science and
			technology and the great voyages of discovery. This collection will
			be made available as part of the Foundations of Science collection
			and closely linked to collections held by the National Maritime
			Museum at Greenwich. Please <a
				href="mailto:foundations@lib.cam.ac.uk">contact us</a> for more
			information about these projects.

		<h4>Introducing the Cambridge Digital Library</h4>
		<p>
			Over the next two years we will be adding a lot of content and
			functionality to this website. You'll be able to explore many of the
			Library's great collections and make use of them within your research
			and learning - whether that takes place within formal education or is
			a personal pursuit. Find out more about the <a href="/about/">Cambridge
