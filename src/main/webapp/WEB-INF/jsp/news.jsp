                        <h4>January Update</h4>
                
			<p>Our January release includes works spanning three continents and many centuries. <a href="/view/MS-GG-00001-00001">MS G.1.1</a> is a fourteenth century compendium containing literary, historical, grammatical, scientific, astronomical, theological, pastoral and devotional texts written in three languages. It is beautifully illustrated with magnificent <a href="/view/MS-GG-00001-00001/821">initials</a>, <a href="/view/MS-GG-00001-00001/988">diagrams</a> and <a href="/view/MS-GG-00001-00001/829">miniatures</a>.</p>

<p><a href="/view/MS-ADD-09597-00002-00018">MS Add 9597/2/18</a> is an important addition to our collection of Isaac Newton’s manuscripts. It includes correspondence with major figures such as Edmund Halley, as well as <a href="/view/MS-ADD-09597-00002-00018/262">Newton’s own notes on the Leibnitz controversy</a>.</p>

<p>Two Hebrew items are included in this update. The first was something of a bestseller among fourteenth and fifteenth-century Jewish doctors. Nathan ben Joel Falaquera's compendium of medical knowledge, <a href="/view/MS-ADD-00628">Balm for the Body</a>, aimed to condense the medical knowledge of the ancient and Islamic worlds and present it in an easily accessible manner to a European Jewish audience. Our copy was a prestigious edition, adorned with illuminated headings and fine pen and ink drawings. The second Hebrew item, from Italy, also belonged to a popular genre, this time of the eighteenth century: a <a href="/view/MS-ADD-00431">map of the holy places of Jerusalem</a>, along with other significant burial sites in the Land of Israel, all drawn schematically. It shows real artistic skill and is one of the finest examples of this type of folk art.</p>


<p>Finally, we have added forty eight manuscripts to our Sanskrit collections, including thirteen with images. Particular highlights include a <a href="/view/MS-ADD-01577">polychrome charm against lightning</a> and a seventeenth century copy of the <a href="/view/MS-OR-02258">Pañcarakṣā or “Five Protections”</a></p>

                        <h4>December Update</h4>
                	<p>The December update to the Digital Library includes two important additions to our Christian Manuscripts collection. <a href='/view/MS-HH-00001-00010'>Hh.1.10</a> is a copy of Ælfric's <i>Grammar and Glossary</i> produced in Exeter about the time of the Norman Conquest. It is written in Old English and contains a copy of one of the earliest Latin grammars written in the vernacular. <a href='/view/MS-II-00001-00033'>Ii.1.33</a>, also by Ælfric, was copied about a century after the Norman Conquest and contains homilies in Old English for many different feasts and saints, including St Æthelthryth who founded Ely Abbey. Both manuscripts were donated to the University Library in 1574 by Matthew Parker.</p>

<p>We are also releasing a number of new manuscripts in our Sanskrit collection, including <a href="/view/MS-ADD-01395">a 14th century copy of the <i>Pañcarakṣā</i></a> with covers decorated with representations of the five Buddhas of directions and the five goddesses of protection.</p>

				With the official launch of our Jisc-funded <a

				the Pacific Ocean and the Arctic. The digitised material is
				supported by a detailed framework of metadata, summaries, essays,
				videos and educational resources to create a rich and exciting
				resource for researchers, teachers, students and the general public.

				In this release we are publishing a further 8,000 Genizah fragments,
				bringing our overall total to 12,000 available on the site. The <a
					href="/collections/genizah">Cairo Genizah Collection</a> at
				Cambridge University Library is the world's largest and most
				important single collection of medieval Jewish manuscripts, and this
				selection includes three autograph texts by the greatest Jewish
				thinker of the Middle Ages, Moses Maimonides (<a
					href="/view/MS-TS-AS-00111-00164">T-S AS 111.164</a>, <a
					href="/view/MS-TS-AS-00149-00089">T-S AS 149.89</a> and <a
					href="/view/MS-MOSSERI-VIII-00024-00001">Mosseri VIII.24.1</a>)
			</p>
			<p>
				We are also releasing three Newton manuscripts - including <a
					href="/view/MS-ADD-04006">MS Add.4006</a>, which contains Newton's
				correspondence with John Flamsteed, the first Astronomer Royal. The
				correspondence touches on the dispute between Flamsteed and the
				Royal Society (of which Newton was the President) over the
				publication of Flamsteed's observations. Newton required real
				observations of the Moon's place for his theoretical work, and
				Flamsteed, who was the holder of those observations, resented
				Newton's imperious demands. In 1712 publication went ahead without
				Flamsteed’s agreement, incensing the Astronomer Royal who referred
				to this as a 'villainous outrage'.

				In addition to the digitisation we have already planned for the
				Cambridge Digital Library, we are pleased to announce two
				externally-funded projects which will add significant content. The
				AHRC are providing funding for the cataloguing of our important
				Sanskrit manuscript collection, which includes some of the earliest
				surviving Buddhist manuscripts. Approximately 1000 of these
				manuscripts will be digitised and made available within the
				Cambridge Digital Library's Foundations of Faith collection. The
				JISC are funding the complete digitisation of the Board of Longitude
				papers, which provide a fascinating record of 18th century science
				and technology and the great voyages of discovery. This collection
				will be made available as part of the Foundations of Science
				collection and closely linked to collections held by the National
				Maritime Museum at Greenwich. Please <a
