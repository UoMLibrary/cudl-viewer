					<h4>June Update</h4>
					
					<p>This release sees the launch of our new <a href='/collections/rcs'>Royal Commonwealth Society collection</a>. The Royal Commonwealth Society Library collections are a treasure-trove of information, pictorial and written, print and manuscript, focussing on the Commonwealth and Britain's former colonial territories. This initial selection highlights the range and scope of our holdings, from spectacular panoramas of <a href='/view/MS-RCMS-00085/1'>Bombay</a> and <a href='/view/MS-RCMS-00086/1'>Simla</a> through to some striking examples from the RCS photographic collections - Sir Henry Norman's <a href='/view/PH-Y-00302-E/1'>images of late nineteenth century French Indo-China, China, Malaya, Siam, Korea and Japan</a>, a <a href='/view/PH-Y-30468-S/1'>set of mounted prints of Lourenço Marques (Maputo, Mozambique)</a>, and a group of <a href='/view/PH-Y-30383-A/1'>spectacular panoramas</a> of Hong Kong, Canton (modern-day Guangzhou), and Macau.</p>

<p>We are also adding a further eight items to our Darwin Manuscripts collection, bringing the total so far to seventy seven complete volumes. Among these is a <a href='/view/MS-DAR-00053-00001/409'>fascinating collection of photographs</a> relating to Darwin’s work on expression. Finally, we are making an important addition to our Christian collection with an 11th century copy of <a href='/view/MS-II-00002-00004/1'>Alfred the Great's translation of Gregory the Great's Pastoral Care</a>.</p>.</p>

					<h4>May Update</h4>
					
					<p>Our May release sees the launch of our new <a href='/collections/chinese'>Chinese collection</a>. Our initial selection shows the temporal range, diversity of media and variety of subject-matter contained within the collection,
					from the three-thousand year old <a href='/view/MS-CUL-00001-00155/1'>Oracle Bones</a> (the oldest documents in the Library), to unique manuscripts and printed books, historical documents and epigraphical rubbings. A particular highlight is a
					<a href='/view/PR-FH-00910-00083-00098/15'>unique copy of a study of calligraphy and painting</a>, described as ‘perhaps the most beautiful set of prints ever made’.</p>
	
					<p>Also included is <a href='/view/MS-RCMS-00352/1'>a very attractive collection of nineteenth century Indian mica paintings</a>, comprising thirty-six miniature portraits from Trichinopoly, dated 1869. Incredibly for objects of such an ephemeral nature,
					the micas reached the Library still brilliantly coloured and fairly intact, but they had become too fragile to handle. A project to conserve and rehouse them is described on the <a href='https://specialcollections.blog.lib.cam.ac.uk/?p=9876'>Library’s
					Special Collections Blog</a>.</p>

					<h4>April Update</h4>
					
					<p>Our April release sees the launch of our new <a href='/collections/michaelides'>Michaelides Fragments collection</a>. Including personal letters, legal texts, accounts, literary texts, recipes and other documents, they comprise
					the largest private collection of Arabic papyri to be found in any institution worldwide. Our initial selection of 64 fragments will be added to over the course of the next two years to provide comprehensive coverage of this
					wonderful resource.</p>
					
					<p>We are also adding a further 743 items to our <a href='/collections/genizah'>Cairo Genizah collection</a>. Of particular interest are Arabic petitions and records made before the Muslim courts. These include a
					<a href='/view/MS-TS-AR-00034-00094/1'>court record (T-S Ar.34.94)</a> from the mid-13th century, where a man named Nāṣir b. Jibrīl engages a Jewish physician to perform surgery on his daughter’s eye. The agreement
					sets the fee for the operation at 2 dirhams, but retains the option to renegotiate it if the operation is a failure. Another document is a <a href='/view/MS-TS-AR-00040-00003/1'>petition to an Ayyubid emir (T-S Ar.40.3, probably 13th century)</a>
					from a resident of the Egyptian town of Minyat Ghamr. This man is suffering at the hands of a neighbour, who has recently moved in and whose young son relentlessly bullies him, including having ‘the audacity to injure [his] wife with his teeth’.
					The long-suffering man demands justice from the emir and punishment for the ‘impudence of the youth’.</a>
					
					<p>Finally, we are making an important addition to our <a href='/collections/music'>Music collection</a>. The <a href='/view/MS-FF-00001-00017-00001/1'><i>Later Cambridge Songs</i></a> (1180-1230 C.E.)
					is a rare survival of what must have been a common type of musical manuscript – an informal production, probably written by performers. Many of the songs are unique to this manuscript and
					it offers a valuable insight into early English music-making.</p>

					<h4>March Update</h4>
					<p>This month sees the release of our new <a href='/collections/waterloo'>Waterloo collection</a>, in support of a major forthcoming exhibition
					at the Library to mark the 200th anniversary of the battle. Containing eyewitness accounts, maps of the battlefield, and beautifully illustrated
					commemorative works, the Collection gives a real sense of the significance of Waterloo to contemporaries and to the generations that followed.
					A particular highlight is a stunning hand-coloured <a href='/view/PR-HARLEY-MASON-A-00025/3'>panoramic view of Wellington’s funeral</a>
					measuring more than 60 feet from end to end.</p>

					<p>Also included are the remarkable <a href='/view/MS-FF-00004-00042/4'>Cambridge Juvencus</a>, a ninth-century manuscript which contains the earliest
					surviving written poetry in Welsh, and the <a href='/view/PR-ATLAS-00002-00061-00001/1'>Speed Maps</a>, a set of seventeenth century maps of the counties
					of England, Scotland and Wales, available for the first time as high-resolution zooming images.</p>

					<p>Regular users of the site will notice that we have undertaken a major redesign of our interface. Hopefully this will
					make the site clearer and easier to use, especially on tablets and mobile devices. Please send any feedback via

				<div class="grid_8">

					<h4>February Update</h4>
					<p>
						Our first release of 2015 sees the addition of 16 volumes to the <a
							href='/collections/darwin_mss'>Darwin Manuscripts</a> collection.
						Amongst these, <a href='/view/MS-DAR-00185'>DAR 185</a> is
						especially interesting, containing <a
							href='/view/MS-DAR-00185/541'>marvellous hand-coloured
							drawings</a> by Darwin’s children on the backs of heavily revised
						pages of the <i>Origin of Species</i> manuscript. Darwin himself
						showed little interest in preserving this draft, and these pages
						were kept for the children’s drawings rather than for their
						content. They give a fascinating glimpse into life inside the
						Darwin household, as well as further insights into the development
						of the <i>Origin</i>.
					</p>

					<p>
						We are also releasing two new music manuscripts, <a
							href='/view/MS-ADD-03389/7'>MS Add.3389</a>, a twelfth-century
						central Italian <i>Gradual</i> removed from the binding of an
						early printed book, and <a href='/view/MS-DOC-00038'>MS Doc.38</a>,
						<i>Indenture for the lease of a property by Mathew Holmes</i>,
						which was formerly the wrapper of <a
							href='/view/MS-NN-00006-00036'>MS Nn.6.36</a>, and was the
						document which identified Holmes as the scribe and owner of one of
						the most important collections of early lute music.

					<h4>November Update</h4>
					<p>
						Our November release sees the launch of our <a
							href='/collections/darwin_mss'>Darwin Manuscripts</a> collection,
						with a selection of papers charting the development of Darwin’s
						evolutionary theory - from early theoretical reflections made
						while on board HMS Beagle to the publication of <i>On the
							Origin of Species</i>. Amongst many highlights are documents of
						worldwide importance such as the “Transmutation” and
						“Metaphysical” notebooks of the 1830s and the 1842 “Pencil Sketch”
						which sees Darwin’s first use of the term <a
							href='/view/MS-DAR-00006/41'>“natural selection”</a>.
					</p>

					<p>
						November also sees the conclusion of the main phase of the <a
							href='/collections/sanskrit'>Sanskrit Manuscripts project</a>,
						detailing more than 1,600 manuscripts, 500 of which are fully
						digitised. Along with important works from the many religious
						traditions of South Asia, including Vedic, Hindu, Buddhist and
						Jainist texts – the collection also includes texts on “secular”
						topics, ranging from works of poetry and drama to treatises on
						philosophy, mathematics, grammar, astronomy, law, eroticism and
						medicine.
					</p>

					<p>Finally, this release sees the introduction of new
						functionality to the website - allowing you to rotate images in
						the viewer, and also improving the user experience for those using
						the site on tablets and mobile devices.</p>

					<h4>October Update</h4>
					<p>
						In our October release we are celebrating the launch of our new <a
							href='/collections/japanese'>Japanese Works</a> collection.
						Cambridge University Library has extremely important holdings of
						early Japanese books and this initial selection includes examples
						of <a href='/view/PR-FG-00870/1'>some of the earliest printing</a>,
						and <a href='/view/MS-FJ-01000-00023/32'>sumptuously
							illustrated scrolls</a>.
					</p>

					<p>
						We are also adding a further fourteen early printed books to our
						collections, in support of the forthcoming Private Lives of Print
						exhibition here at the University Library. Among the highlights
						are <a href='/view/PR-INC-00003-A-00001-00008-00037/1'>Ortus
							sanitatis</a>, one of the first natural history encyclopaedias, and a
						<a href='/view/PR-INC-00005-D-00001-00019-02530/1'>beautifully

				<div class="grid_8">
					<span class="date">24/09/2014</span>
					<h4>September Update</h4>
					<p>
						Our September release includes nearly four and a half thousand <a
							href='/collections/spanishchapbooks'>Spanish Chapbooks</a> from
						the collections of the UL and the British Library. These
						fascinating predecessors of the yellow press provide a bird's eye
						view of popular culture in Spain from the eighteenth century
						onwards, including accounts of gory crimes, heroic criminals, and
						wayward citizens. The collection was catalogued and digitised for
						the AHRC-funded project 'Wrongdoing in Spain 1800-1936: Realities,
						Representations, Reactions’, which focused on particular aspects
						of the cultural representation of wrongdoing and its relation (or
						lack of it) to historical realities at the time of production. The
						material in this collection provides a unique base for tracking
						such interests within the field of popular literature.
					</p>

					<p>
						We are also adding over thirty manuscripts to our Sanskrit
						Collection. Particular highlights include <a
							href='/view/MS-ADD-01049-00001'>Add.1049.1</a>, one of the oldest
						known dated Sanskrit manuscripts from South Asia, and <a
							href='/view/MS-ADD-00864'>Add.864</a>, a masterfully crafted and
						intricately illustrated 16th-century Nepalese accordion book.

					<h4>August Update</h4>

					<p>
						Our August release marks the 100th anniversary of the beginning of
						the First World War with the release of <a
							href='/collections/sassoon'>Siegfried Sassoon's wartime
							journals and poetry notebooks</a>.
					</p>

					<p>
						The journals give a fascinating insight into daily life in the
						trenches, including Sassoon's <a
							href='/view/MS-ADD-09852-00001-00007/19'>description of the
							first day of the Somme</a>, the moment he was <a
							href='/view/MS-ADD-09852-00001-00010/14'>shot by a sniper at
							the Battle of Arras</a>, and a <a
							href='/view/MS-ADD-09852-00001-00007/7'>haunting sketch of
							‘the soul of an officer’</a>. Two of the journals are marked with
						traces of <a href='/view/MS-ADD-09852-00001-00007/137'>mud</a> and
						<a href='/view/MS-ADD-09852-00001-00009/27'>candle wax</a> from
						Sassoon's time in the trenches.
					</p>

					<p>
						The poems include previously unpublished material along with
						drafts of some of his best-known works including an <a
							href='/view/MS-ADD-09852-00006-00002/159'>early version of
							‘The Dug-Out’</a> with an additional, excised verse.

					<h4>June Update</h4>

					<p>
						A particular highlight of our June release is a beautiful copy of
						Vesalius' <a href='/view/PR-CCF-00046-00036/1' target='_blank'><i>Epitome</i></a>,
						a companion piece to his <i>Seven books on the fabric of the
							human body</i>. Published in 1543 the <i>Epitome</i> includes a
						number of detailed anatomical woodcuts, as well as an
						extraordinary <a href='/view/PR-CCF-00046-00036/45'
							target='_blank'>three-dimensional manikin</a>.
					</p>

					<p>
						To coincide with the opening of a <a
							href="http://www.rmg.co.uk/whats-on/events/ships-clocks-stars"
							target="_blank">major exhibition at the National Maritime
							Museum</a>, we are making an important addition to our Longitude
						Collection. The <a href='/view/MS-H-17809/1' target='_blank'><i>Account
								of John Harrison and his chronometer</i></a> is one of the most
						interesting and complex sources in the history of the Board of
						Longitude, detailing Harrison's long and often fraught
						relationship with the Board. Written from Harrison's point of view
						it provides an intriguing counterpoint to other material in the
						Collection, often describing the same events from a very different
						perspective. We have also taken the opportunity to enrich our
						presentation of the <a href='/view/MS-REG-00009-00037/1'
							target='_blank'><i>Papers of Nevil Maskelyne</i></a> with a full,
						searchable index and table of contents.
					</p>

					<p>
						Our Christian Collection continues to grow with the addition of MS
						CUL Ff.1.25, a composite manuscript made up of five different
						parts of different dates, compiled in the sixteenth century.
						Donated to the Library by Archbishop Matthew Parker in 1574,
						Ff.1.25 contains copies of many important medieval texts,
						including Geoffrey of Monmouth's <a
							href='/view/MS-FF-00001-00025-00005/1' target='_blank'><i>Historia
								regum Britanniae</i></a>.

					<h4>May Update</h4>

					<p>
						Our May release includes <a href='/view/MS-KK-00003-00018/24'>MS
							Kk.3.18</a> one of only five surviving copies of the Old English
						translation of Bede's <i>Historia ecclesiastica gentis
							anglorum</i>. Written in Worcester in the second half of the 11th
						century, it is extensively annotated in English and Latin,
						including notes added by the so-called 'Tremulous Hand', a scribe
						whose additions to numerous Worcester manuscripts are dated c.
						1225-1250.
					</p>

					<p>
						Of the fifteen new items in our Sanskrit Collection, a particular
						highlight is <a href='/view/MS-ADD-01278/1'>MS Add.1278</a>, a
						wonderful example of an 'accordion book', containing a Tantric
						Buddhist text. Also included is <a href='/view/MS-OR-01818/1'>MS
							Or.1818</a>, a collection of devotional works of vaiṣṇava
						affiliation. Both are beautifully illustrated throughout. An
						additional highlight is <a href='/view/MS-ADD-01698/1'>MS
							Add.1698</a>, which was composed in 1386 and is in the original hand
						of the author. Autograph Sanskrit manuscripts of this antiquity
						are extremely rare.
					</p>

					<p>
						We are also adding over five hundred fragments to our Genizah
						collection. Among them are copies of the only known Medieval
						Hebrew poem by a woman (<a
							href='view/MS-MOSSERI-VIII-00202-00002/1'>Mosseri VIII.202.2</a>
						and <a href='/view/MS-TS-NS-00143-00046/1'>T-S NS 143.46</a>), a
						10th century letter which is believed to be documentary proof of
						the existence of Khazar Jews in Kiev (<a
							href='/view/MS-TS-00012-00122/1'>T-S 12.122</a>) and a court
						record dealing with a famous case of murder (<a

					<h4>March Update</h4>

					<p>
						Among the many highlights of this release are two sketchbooks by
						Conrad Martens, the official artist aboard the <i>Beagle</i> from
						July 1833 to July 1834. The sketches and watercolours in <a
							href='/view/MS-ADD-07983/1'>MS Add.7983</a> and <a
							href='/view/MS-ADD-07984/1'>MS Add. 7984</a> include depictions
						of local landscapes, people, flora and fauna and give a vivid
						insight into what has become one of the most famous voyages in the
						world, owing to Marten’s shipmate and lifelong friend Charles
						Darwin.
					</p>

					<p>
						There are two further important additions to our Christian
						Collection. The first is a <a href='/view/MS-GG-00004-00006/1'>fourteenth
							century copy of the <i>Roman de la Rose</i>
						</a>, probably the most important and influential literary work
						written in medieval French. This manuscript is full of beautiful
						illustrations by Richard de Montbaston (fl. 1325-1353), a
						professional illustrator who lived and worked with his wife Jeanne
						(fl. 1338-1353) on the rue Neuve Notre-Dame in Paris. The second
						is the <a href='/view/MS-DD-00005-00005/1'><i>Breviary of
								Marie de Saint Pol</i></a>, an illuminated prayer book commissioned by
						Marie de Saint Pol, Countess of Pembroke (c. 1304-1377) and
						founder of Pembroke College, Cambridge.
					<p>
						Also in this release are <a href='/view/MS-OR-00476/1'>MS
							Or.476</a> and <a href='/view/MS-OR-00771/1'>MS Or.771</a>, two
						Qur'ānic fragments from the 9th or 10th century. This brings the
						total number of early Qur'āns and Qur'ānic fragments in our <a
							href='/collections/islamic#1'>Islamic Collection</a> to forty
						six, providing a rich resource for researchers.
					</p>

					<p>
						Finally, we are adding a further fifteen manuscripts to our
						Sanskrit Collection, amongst which are beautifully illuminated
						copies of the <a href='/view/MS-OR-02258/1'>Pañcarakṣā</a> and <a
							href='/view/MS-ADD-01326/1'>Dhāraṇīsaṅgraha</a> dating from the

					<h4>February Update</h4>

					<p>
						A major highlight of our February release is <a
							href="/view/MS-FF-00001-00024">Ff.1.24</a>, a Greek manuscript
						probably made in Constantinople in the tenth century. Owned and <a
							href="/view/MS-FF-00001-00024/55">extensively annotated</a> by
						Robert Grosseteste, consulted by Frances Bacon, and given to the
						Library by Archbishop Matthew Parker, this fascinating manuscript
						offers an insight into the working habits and library of one of
						the major intellectuals figure of the thirteenth century, and
						casts light on the tradition of Greek scholarship and transmission
						of Greek texts in the Medieval West.
					</p>

					<p>
						We are also adding fourteen manuscripts to our <a
							href="/collections/sanskrit">Sanskrit Collection</a>, including <a
							href="/view/MS-ADD-01644/2">Add.1644</a> and <a
							href="/view/MS-ADD-01647/2">Add.1647</a>, two beautifully
						illuminated thirteenth century copies of the Pañcarakṣā or “Five
						Protections”.</a>
					<p>
						And we are releasing nearly five hundred additional fragments in
						our <a href="/collections/genizah">Cairo Genizah Collection</a>,
						bringing the total number online to over sixteen thousand. Of
						particular interest is <a href="/view/MS-TS-00006-J-00007-00003/1">T-S
							6J7.3</a>, a letter from a man to his father, probably written after

						<h4>January Update</h4>

						<p>
							Our January release includes works spanning three continents and
							many centuries. <a href="/view/MS-GG-00001-00001">MS G.1.1</a> is
							a fourteenth century compendium containing literary, historical,
							grammatical, scientific, astronomical, theological, pastoral and
							devotional texts written in three languages. It is beautifully
							illustrated with magnificent <a
								href="/view/MS-GG-00001-00001/821">initials</a>, <a
								href="/view/MS-GG-00001-00001/988">diagrams</a> and <a
								href="/view/MS-GG-00001-00001/829">miniatures</a>.
						</p>

						<p>
							<a href="/view/MS-ADD-09597-00002-00018">MS Add 9597/2/18</a> is
							an important addition to our collection of Isaac Newton’s
							manuscripts. It includes correspondence with major figures such
							as Edmund Halley, as well as <a
								href="/view/MS-ADD-09597-00002-00018/262">Newton’s own notes
								on the Leibnitz controversy</a>.
						</p>

						<p>
							Two Hebrew items are included in this update. The first was
							something of a bestseller among fourteenth and fifteenth-century
							Jewish doctors. Nathan ben Joel Falaquera's compendium of medical
							knowledge, <a href="/view/MS-ADD-00628">Balm for the Body</a>,
							aimed to condense the medical knowledge of the ancient and
							Islamic worlds and present it in an easily accessible manner to a
							European Jewish audience. Our copy was a prestigious edition,
							adorned with illuminated headings and fine pen and ink drawings.
							The second Hebrew item, from Italy, also belonged to a popular
							genre, this time of the eighteenth century: a <a
								href="/view/MS-ADD-00431">map of the holy places of
								Jerusalem</a>, along with other significant burial sites in the Land
							of Israel, all drawn schematically. It shows real artistic skill
							and is one of the finest examples of this type of folk art.
						</p>

						<p>
							Finally, we have added forty five manuscripts to our Sanskrit
							collections, including twelve with images. Particular highlights
							include a <a href="/view/MS-ADD-01577">polychrome charm
								against lightning</a> and a twelfth century illuminated copy of the
							<a href="/view/MS-OR-00142-00001">Vasudhāradhāraṇī</a>, one of
							the earliest extant manuscripts of this text

						<h4>December Update</h4>
						<p>
							The December update to the Digital Library includes two important
							additions to our Christian Manuscripts collection. <a
								href='/view/MS-HH-00001-00010'>Hh.1.10</a> is a copy of Ælfric's
							<i>Grammar and Glossary</i> produced in Exeter about the time of
							the Norman Conquest. It is written in Old English and contains a
							copy of one of the earliest Latin grammars written in the
							vernacular. <a href='/view/MS-II-00001-00033'>Ii.1.33</a>, also
							by Ælfric, was copied about a century after the Norman Conquest
							and contains homilies in Old English for many different feasts
							and saints, including St Æthelthryth who founded Ely Abbey. Both
							manuscripts were donated to the University Library in 1574 by
							Matthew Parker.
						</p>

						<p>
							We are also releasing a number of new manuscripts in our Sanskrit
							collection, including <a href="/view/MS-ADD-01395">a 14th
								century copy of the <i>Pañcarakṣā</i>
							</a> with covers decorated with representations of the five Buddhas
							of directions and the five goddesses of protection.

							We are also releasing three Newton manuscripts - including <a

							Newton's correspondence with John Flamsteed, the first Astronomer
							Royal. The correspondence touches on the dispute between
							Flamsteed and the Royal Society (of which Newton was the
							President) over the publication of Flamsteed's observations.
							Newton required real observations of the Moon's place for his
							theoretical work, and Flamsteed, who was the holder of those
							observations, resented Newton's imperious demands. In 1712
							publication went ahead without Flamsteed’s agreement, incensing
							the Astronomer Royal who referred to this as a 'villainous
							outrage'.

							of these manuscripts will be digitised and made available within
							the Cambridge Digital Library's Foundations of Faith collection.
							The JISC are funding the complete digitisation of the Board of
							Longitude papers, which provide a fascinating record of 18th
							century science and technology and the great voyages of
							discovery. This collection will be made available as part of the
							Foundations of Science collection and closely linked to
							collections held by the National Maritime Museum at Greenwich.
