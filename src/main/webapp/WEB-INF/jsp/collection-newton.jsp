		<p>Cambridge University Library holds the largest and most
			important collection of the scientific works of Isaac Newton
			(1642-1727). We present here an initial selection of Newton's
			manuscripts, concentrating on his mathematical work in the 1660s.
			Over the next few months we will be adding further works until the
			majority of our Newton Papers are available on this site.</p>

		<p>Newton was closely associated with Cambridge. He came to the
			University as a student in 1661, graduating in 1665, and from 1669 to
			1701 he held the Lucasian Chair of Mathematics. Under the regulations
			for this Chair, Newton was required to deposit copies of his lectures
			in the University Library. These, and some correspondence relating to
			the University, were assigned the classmarks Dd.4.18, Dd.9.46,
			Dd.9.67, Dd.9.68, and Mm.6.50.</p>

		<p>In 1699 Newton was appointed Master of the Mint, and in 1703 he
			was elected President of the Royal Society, a post he occupied until
			his death.</p>

		<p>After his death, the manuscripts in Newton's possession passed
			to his niece Catherine and her husband John Conduitt. In 1740 the
			Conduitt's daughter, also Catherine, married John Wallop, who became
			Viscount Lymington when his father was created first Earl of
			Portsmouth. Their son became the second earl and the manuscripts were
			passed down succeeding generations of the family.</p>

		<p>In 1872 the fifth earl passed all the Newton manuscripts he had
			to the University of Cambridge, where they were assessed and a
			detailed catalogue made. Based on this catalogue, the earl generously
			presented all the mathematical and scientific manuscripts to the
			University, and it is these that form the Library's 'Portsmouth
			collection' (MSS Add. 3958-Add. 4007).</p>

		<p>The remainder of the Newton papers, many concerned with
			alchemy, theology and chronology, were returned to Lord Portsmouth.
			They were sold at auction at Sotheby's in London in 1936 and
			purchased by other libraries and individuals.</p>

		<p>In 2000 Cambridge University Library acquired a very important
			collection of scientific manuscripts from the Earl of Macclesfield,
			which included a significant number of Isaac Newton's letters and
			other papers.</p>
