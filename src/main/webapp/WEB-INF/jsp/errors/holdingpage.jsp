				<h3>Laying the foundations of a digital library for the world</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="grid_12">
				<p>Cambridge University Library is undertaking significant
					development work and digitisation to open up its collections to the
					world via the web. Content will begin to become available from this
					address in early November 2011 and then grow considerably over the
					next two years. We will be putting up a wide range of content from
					the Library's great collections, but will focus particularly on two
					themes: faith and science.</p>

				<h4>Foundations of Science</h4>
				<p>Cambridge University Library has very strong collections in
					the history of Science. The Library holds the papers of Isaac
					Newton, Charles Darwin, Lord Kelvin, Adam Sedgwick, J.J. Thompson,
					Ernest Rutherford, James Clerk Maxwell, Sir George Gabriel Stokes
					and many others. It is also the repository of the Royal Greenwich
					Observatory archives, which includes the papers of the Astronomers
					Royal and the Board of Longitude papers, and the archives of
					Cambridge's Cavendish Laboratory. The initial focus for the
					Foundations of Science Collection will be on Seventeenth and
					Eighteenth Century Science. Our first release of content, in
					November 2011, will include a selection of manuscripts from the
					Papers of Isaac Newton.</p>

				<h4>Foundations of Faith</h4>
				<p>The Foundations of Faith Collection will include important
					works from many religious traditions, particularly Judaism, Islam,
					Christianity and Buddhism. The Library's faith collections are
					breathtaking. They include some of the oldest and most significant
					Qur'ans ever to be uncovered, as well as an Eighth Century copy of
					Surat al-Anfal. The Library holds the world's largest and most
					important collection of Jewish Genizah materials, including the
					Taylor-Schechter Genizah Collection - 193,000 fragments of
					manuscripts considered by many to be as significant as the Dead Sea
					Scrolls. Our Christian holdings include the Codex Bezae
					Cantabrigiensis, one of the most important New Testament
					manuscripts, and the Book of Deer and Book of Cerne. Among the
					Library's substantial Sanskrit collection are some of the earliest
					surviving Buddhist manuscripts.</p>
