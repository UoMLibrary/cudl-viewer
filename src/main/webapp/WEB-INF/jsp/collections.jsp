			<p>Cambridge University Library holds the largest and most
				important collection of the scientific works of Isaac Newton
				(1642-1727). We present here an initial selection of Newton's
				manuscripts, concentrating on his mathematical work in the 1660s.
				Over the next few months we will be adding further works until the
				majority of our Newton Papers are available on this site.</p>

			<p>Newton was closely associated with Cambridge. He came to the
				University as a student in 1661, graduating in 1665, and from 1669
				to 1701 he held the Lucasian Chair of Mathematics. Under the
				regulations for this Chair, Newton was required to deposit copies of
				his lectures in the University Library. These, and some
				correspondence relating to the University, were assigned the
				classmarks Dd.4.18, Dd.9.46, Dd.9.67, Dd.9.68, and Mm.6.50.</p>

			<p>In 1699 Newton was appointed Master of the Mint, and in 1703
				he was elected President of the Royal Society, a post he occupied
				until his death.</p>

			<p>After his death, the manuscripts in Newton's possession passed
				to his niece Catherine and her husband John Conduitt. In 1740 the
				Conduitt's daughter, also Catherine, married John Wallop, who became
				Viscount Lymington when his father was created first Earl of
				Portsmouth. Their son became the second earl and the manuscripts
				were passed down succeeding generations of the family.</p>

			<p>In 1872 the fifth earl passed all the Newton manuscripts he
				had to the University of Cambridge, where they were assessed and a
				detailed catalogue made. Based on this catalogue, the earl
				generously presented all the mathematical and scientific manuscripts
				to the University, and it is these that form the Library's
				'Portsmouth collection' (MSS Add. 3958-Add. 4007).</p>

			<p>The remainder of the Newton papers, many concerned with
				alchemy, theology and chronology, were returned to Lord Portsmouth.
				They were sold at auction at Sotheby's in London in 1936 and
				purchased by other libraries and individuals.</p>
				
			<p>In 2000 Cambridge University Library acquired a very important
				collection of scientific manuscripts from the Earl of Macclesfield,
				which included a significant number of Isaac Newton's letters and
				other papers.</p>
