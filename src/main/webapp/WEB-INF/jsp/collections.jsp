			Cambridge University Library holds the largest and most important
			collection of Newton's scientific works. Isaac Newton (1642-1727)
			came to the University of Cambridge as a student in 1661, graduating
			in 1665. In 1669 he succeeded Isaac Barrow in the Lucasian Chair of
			Mathematics. In 1699 Newton was appointed Master of the Mint,
			resigning the Lucasian Chair and his Trinity College Fellowship in
			1701. He was elected President of the Royal Society in 1703, which
			post he occupied until his death. <br /> <br /> Under the
			regulations for the Lucasian Chair, Newton deposited copies of his
			lectures in the University Library in the seventeenth century. These,
			and some correspondence relating to the University, were assigned the
			classmarks Dd.4.18, Dd.9.46, Dd.9.67, Dd.9.68, and Mm.6.50. <br /> <br />
			After his death, the manuscripts in Newton's possession passed to his
			niece Catherine and her husband John Conduitt. In 1740 the Conduitt's
			daughter, also Catherine, married John Wallop, who became Viscount
			Lymington when his father was created first Earl of Portsmouth. Their
			son became the second earl, the manuscripts then being inherited by
			succeeding generations of the Portsmouth family. <br /> <br /> In
			1872 the fifth earl passed all the Newton manuscripts he had to the
			University of Cambridge, where the manuscripts were assessed and a
			catalogue made. Based on this catalogue, the earl generously
			presented all the mathematical and scientific manuscripts to the
			University, and it is these that form the 'Portsmouth collection' in
			the University Library (MSS Add. 3958-4007). <br /> <br /> The
			remainder of the papers, many concerned with alchemy, theology and
			chronology, were returned to Lord Portsmouth as being of little
			scientific interest. These manuscripts were then sold at auction at
			Sotheby's in London in 1936 and purchased by other libraries and
			individuals. <br /> <br /> In 2000 Cambridge University Library
			acquired a very important collection of scientific manuscripts from
			the Earl of Macclesfield, which included a significant number of
			Isaac Newton's letters and other papers.
