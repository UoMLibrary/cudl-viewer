				<a name="links"><b>How do link to a specific page within a
						book?</b> </a>
			</p>

			<p>Our website URLs have the format:</p>
			<p>http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/[item id]/[page number]</p>
			<p>
				So <a href="/view/MS-ADD-03996/5">http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-ADD-03996/5</a>
				links to page 5 in item MS-ADD-03996 (The Trinity College Notebook).
			</p>


			<p>
				<a name="view"><b>How do I change page while seeing as much
						of the manuscript as possible?</b> </a>
			</p>

			<p>The right panel, which shows some information about the item
				can be collapsed by clicking on the double arrow icon in the far
				right of the screen. This will allow you to view more of the image
				while you can still page forward and backwards through the book.</p>

			<p>
				<a name="socialmedia"><b>How do I share a book on Facebook,
						Twitter, etc.?</b> </a>
			</p>

			<p>There are social media icons in the top right of the About
				tab. Clicking on any of them will allow you to share the item with
				others.</p>
			<p>
				<a name="tech"><b>What technologies are behind the Cambridge
						Digital Library?</b> </a>
			</p>

			<p>
				We aim to use primarily open source technologies, and to avoid the
				use of plugins to make the accessible to as many people as possible.
				For the website we use a collection of JavaScript libraries
				including <a
					href="http://gallery.expression.microsoft.com/SeadragonAjax"
					target="_blank">Seadragon Ajax</a> for the zoomable images, <a
					href="http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs" target="_blank">ExtJS</a>,
				<a href="http://jquery.com/" target="_blank">JQuery</a> and <a
					href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/glow/" target="_blank">Glow</a>. Behind
				the scenes we use <a href="http://xtf.cdlib.org/" target="_blank">XTF</a>
				and <a href="http://www.goobi.org/" target="_blank">Goobi</a> for
				digitising and indexing the data. The website was created by the
				digital library team at Cambridge University Library and is written
				in Java. You can find out more on our <a href="/contributors/">Contributors</a>
				page.
			</p>

			<p>
				<a name="standards"><b>What kind of standards do you use for
						data?</b> </a>
			</p>
			<p>
				Our data is primarily in MODS and TEI formats, and we would like to
				provide our data for others to download and use. Please <a
					href="mailto:foundations@lib.cam.ac.uk">let us know</a> what
				format/APIs would be most useful to you.
			</p>

			<p>
				<a name="pdf"><b>Will you be offering whole pdfs of the
						manuscripts to download (for e-readers for example)?</b> </a>
			</p>

			<p>This is something which we would very much like to do, however
				this may result in very large files, so may not be suitable for all
				books.</p>

			<p>
				<a name="languages"><b>Many of the books seem to be in Latin
						or Greek, why is this?</b> </a>
			</p>

			<p>Around the time many of the books were written these would be
				the normal languages scholars would have used. Sometimes English was
				also used for more informal notes.</p>

			<p>
				<a name="digitisation"><b>Why can't I see all books in
						Cambridge University Library online?</b> </a>
			</p>

			<p>
				We are just starting to build our online collection, so we only have
				a few works online at the moment. You may be able to find what you
				are looking for at the <a
					href="http://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/eresources/" target="_blank">eresources@cambridge
					website</a>.
